    "text": "The OnePlus Watch 3 43mm smartwatch has just been announced\n\nThe device is the smaller sibling to the OnePlus Watch 3\n\nIt’s due to launch on July 8 alongside four other products\n\nOnePlus has announced that it's launching a new smartwatch for smaller wrists on July 8. The new device – dubbed the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm – will be available alongside the larger Watch 3, which measures a chunkier 46mm across.\n\nOnePlus says the Watch 3 43mm will come with a 1.32-inch display and a stainless steel chassis that weighs 37.8 grams. That makes it far lighter than the larger Watch 3, which tips the scales at 81g, and means the 43mm model is the “most compact smartwatch” the company has ever made.\n\nThe screen crystal has what OnePlus describes as a “2.5D micro-curved design” that provides “a seamless transition between different materials and creating an elegantly unified aesthetic.” Its face comes with screen-printed 12-hour indices for straightforward time display. It's only available in one color though: Silver Steel.\n\nDespite its traditional appearance, the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm is packing smart features including the company’s Mind & Body Evaluation tracking. It’s got a real-time barometer that can gauge your fatigue every 30 minutes, it can track your stress and help you understand what’s causing it, and it’s able to provide daily and weekly trends on your mind and body status, among other features.\n\nNew devices galore\n\n(Image credit: OnePlus)\n\nThe Watch 3 43mm isn't the only new device OnePlus is set to unveil on July 8. The company has also announced that it will be releasing four other devices at the same time: the OnePlus Nord 5, OnePlus Nord CE 5, OnePlus Buds 4 and OnePlus Pad Lite. These products – as well as the Watch 3 43mm – were revealed earlier in June when we sat down with OnePlus for an exclusive interview.\n\nThe original OnePlus Watch 3 made it onto our list of the best smartwatches on the market – in fact we judged it to be the best Wear OS smartwatch that isn’t made by Google – so the new model stands in good company. If it’s able to continue what its larger sibling started, it’ll be a strong contender in a competitive smartwatch scene.\n\nAs for pricing for the Watch 3 43mm, OnePlus is keeping that under wraps for now (although we’ve reached out and will update this post when we hear back). However, with tariffs already affecting the price of the regular Watch 3, rumors have been swirling that the smaller wearable could follow suit. We’ll be keeping our eyes open over the next few weeks to see what happens.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "How (not) to track your health",
    "url": "https://www.vox.com/technology/417713/apple-watch-oura-whoop-health-tracking-fitness",
    "text": "is a senior technology correspondent at Vox and author of the User Friendly newsletter. He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like The Atlantic, Gizmodo, and Vice.\n\nYou’d think I would have been more self-conscious about walking around New York City while wearing no fewer than six health trackers at a time. For the first six months of this year, I wore smart rings on both hands, fitness bands on both wrists, biosensors plugged into my arms, and sometimes even headphones that monitored my brain activity. I was a little embarrassed, sure, but mostly I was anxious.\n\nThis health tracking ensemble was part of an experiment — a failed one, I’ll admit. By tracking as many health metrics as possible, I thought I’d find a way to feel younger, more energetic, and more fit. Products like the Oura ring, the Whoop band, the Apple Watch, and a growing variety of continuous glucose monitors promise to track things like your heart rate, body temperature, and metabolic health metrics, while their companion apps crunch that data into actionable advice about how to live your life. If one health tracker is good for you, theoretically, half a dozen should be great.\n\nWhat I learned from obsessively tracking my health for half a year is that paying too much attention to what your body is doing can ruin your life. Or at least it can ruin your understanding of healthy living, since too much information can steer your brain toward assuming the worst. Looking at the readouts from these fitness tracking apps sent me down dark holes of Googling symptoms and self-diagnosing conditions that my doctor assured me I did not have. But, I reasoned, he did not have all of the data that the health tracker collected, so he could be wrong, and AI, which is increasingly embedded in this tech, is very good at diagnosing things.\n\nI wouldn’t caution against any and all health tracking. Now that the experiment is over, I’m only ever wearing one health tracker at a time. I’ve gained a new appreciation for how technology could become an essential part of healthy living in the near future, if you do it right. I’m not saying I have all the answers, but there are some things I would recommend to tracker-curious readers. And there are some things I would avoid at all costs.\n\nToday, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nDo wear a smart ring when you sleep\n\nOut of over a dozen gadgets tested, the one device that I added to my daily routine is an Oura ring that I only wear at night. (During the day, I wear an Apple Watch.) An Oura ring is a sensor-packed smart ring that measures a lot of the same things as a smartwatch, but is easier to wear while you sleep. The ring keeps track of your heart rate and movement to sense how well you sleep. Exactly how it does this is controversial with some sleep doctors, but it nonetheless generates a sleep score, which is oddly compelling.\n\nThe first thing I do every morning, I’m almost embarrassed to say, is check my sleep score in the Oura app. If it’s bad, I feel vindicated for feeling groggy. If it’s good, I feel energized, even if I still feel groggy. The sleep score is a made-up metric, one that may or may not be correct based on how Oura’s algorithms calculate various factors, but paying attention to the score was helpful for me.\n\n“The way that we think about how we’ve slept can really make us feel better,” Thea Gallagher, a psychologist at NYU Langone Health, told me. “If we think we’ve had a good night of sleep, we will actually feel better physically and mentally and emotionally.”\n\nPlacebo effect notwithstanding, I’m also surprised by how much I listen to an app when it tells me to go to bed. Thanks to the Oura app, I’ve developed better sleeping habits, and frankly, I feel better.\n\nDo start out with a clear goal in mind\n\nWhen I first got an Apple Watch, I liked the rings that track how much you move. Moving more seemed like an easy goal that would improve my health. But some trackers seem to collect data for the sake of collecting data, with no particular objective.\n\nContinuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, have been lifesavers for people with diabetes for years, but a growing list of companies sell them to non-diabetics over the counter. These biosensors stick a filament into your skin that measures the amount of glucose in your interstitial fluid, which can give you a good guess about what your blood glucose is at any given moment. If you don’t know a lot about how metabolism works, the readouts can be horrifying. The first bowl of cereal I ate spiked my blood sugar outside of the normal range, which threw me into a panic — a panic that didn’t entirely subside until I stopped wearing these sensors.\n\nPart of what fueled that anxiety was the fact that I didn’t actually know how to make sense of the data that these monitors spit out. Most of them alert you when your glucose is spiking and then give you some kind of score, but it’s not clear what a good score indicates other than that you’ve managed to eat fewer carbs, probably. The whole experience can feel like a high-tech diet.\n\n“There’s not a lot of time and effort spent on figuring out what is the actual question that I have that’s really important to me and that I’m willing to go through some some effort and troubleshooting in order to come out the other side with a genuine discovery that I can use in my regular life,” said Gary Wolf, a tech journalist and founder of Quantified Self, a community of people who have been tracking their health metrics since the mid-2000s.\n\nDon’t send your poop or blood to anyone in the mail\n\nHealth tracking isn’t confined to wearable devices. Some companies, like Viome, Function Health, and Ultrahuman, are getting into the labwork business. The idea is that you can pay for extra testing and get all the results back in an app that promises to help you understand the intricate details of your gut microbiome or metabolic health. Some assign you a biological age based on your test results, and all of them cost many hundreds of dollars.\n\nI did a battery of tests through Viome, including the gut microbiome test, which involved filling up little vials with poop and blood and dropping them at a post office. (Disclosure: Viome waived the fees for me.) The results seemed to tell me nothing that I didn’t already reveal on the pre-test questionnaire, but I did have the opportunity to buy some very expensive supplements to address my problem areas. I don’t recommend doing any of this.\n\nDon’t pay for a subscription unless the gadget really improves your life\n\nIf you’ve ever seen someone wearing a band around their wrist with a little hunk of plastic where the watch face should be, you’ve seen a Whoop band. This fitness-forward health tracker works a lot like a smartwatch without a screen, but the app is geared toward gym rats. The app not only gives you a strain score that measures how hard you’ve worked out, it also encourages you to recover. It costs $30 a month to enjoy all the features.\n\nIt’s not just Whoop that wants you to keep paying. Oura also charges a subscription fee to unlock all of its features, but it’s just $6. Apple has the Fitness+ subscription for $10, but that includes a bunch of classes, not unique features on the Watch. All of these little fees add up over time, so if you really just want basic functionality, skip the subscription. Without it, you can still see your sleep, readiness, and activity scores on an Oura ring. (That’s all I look at anyway.) The Whoop band doesn’t work at all if you don’t pay.\n\nDo take breaks\n\nThe best advice I got from the many experts I talked to throughout my health tracking journey was to take off the devices from time to time. The absolute flood of information about my health often made me uneasy, and it even led to some disordered behaviors, especially when it came to tracking my glucose levels and seeing my readings start veering away from normal levels. Still, I wondered if I shouldn’t intervene somehow.\n\n“Sometimes atypical results found by wearables can make people anxious, and it may be difficult to offer them definite reassurance for these results,” said Dr. David Klonoff, president of the Diabetes Technology Society. “If traditional medicine cannot provide definite answers, then these people sometimes turn to natural or alternative medicine.”\n\nSome health tracking companies want to take your money every month to keep using their services. Some want to sell you the latest generation of their device. Some want to sell you supplements. They all want you to keep using the trackers and apps, even if they’re not necessarily making you healthier. That’s good to keep in mind.\n\nSo check in with yourself when you’re wearing a health tracker. Take it off, and leave it off for a while. Without a torrent of alerts telling you to stand, sleep, or eat, you may actually feel better."

    "text": "A piece of 99 million-year-old amber has revealed a shocking sight. It’s a fly with a zombie fungus growing from its head. Another fossil in the same amber shows a young ant infected by a similar fungus. The ant and the fly were then trapped in sticky tree sap that became amber.\n\nThese are among the oldest known examples of fungi controlling insects, killing them in the process. Chinese researchers studies the fossils by using microscopes and 3D scans.\n\nLead author Yuhui Zhuang from Yunnan University said such rare finds help in understanding ancient relationships between fungi and insects.\n\nAlso Read | Scientists are stunned by how these tiny insects use Milky Way as a guide\n\n“Overall, these two fossils are very rare, at least among the tens of thousands of amber specimens we’ve seen, and only a few have preserved the symbiotic relationship between fungi and insects,” CNN quoted Zhuang as saying.\n\n“The discovery of these two fossils suggests that terrestrial ecosystems were already very complex, and that Ophiocordyceps, in particular, may have begun to act as ‘predators’ of insects in the Cretaceous period, regulating the populations of certain groups,” Zhuang added.\n\nAlso Read | Are we inside a black hole? New study challenges Big Bang theory\n\nSome fungi are called “zombie-ant fungi” because they can control ants’ behaviour to spread their spores. This strange idea inspired the video game and TV series The Last of Us.\n\nScientists believe the fungus found in a fossilised ant could be an early form of today’s zombie-ant fungi. These fungi likely controlled the ant’s body before killing it.\n\nSuch ancient parasitic fungi are very rare, so not much is known about their history. Experts say these fungi played a big role in shaping life on Earth.\n\nEven though amber shows us many hidden species, we still only see a tiny part of the full picture. Each insect probably carried many unseen parasites, fungi or bacteria.\n\nNew fossil discovery The new fossil discovery shows these fungi existed even during the dinosaur era, around 99 million years ago, and had already attacked insects. According to experts, they may have helped control insect populations back then.\n\nToday, such fungi still infect many insects like ants, flies and beetles. Scientists say the fungus enters the ant’s body through a weak spot and reaches its brain to control its actions."

It posted CCTV footage showing a group of at least 10 masked men setting one car on fire and throwing stones.\n\n\"The settler violence and rampage, under the protection of the occupation army, is a political decision by the Israeli government, implemented by the settlers,\" Palestinian Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh wrote on X.\n\n\"The Israeli government's behaviour and decisions are pushing the region toward an explosion.

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ControlUp, a global leader in Digital Employee Experience (DEX) management tools, today announced new findings from its Windows 11 Readiness report , revealing that 50% of enterprise Windows endpoints have yet to complete their migration to Windows 11. This marks a significant improvement from last year’s data, when over 82% of enterprise devices were not running Windows 11 . With just under four months remaining until Microsoft officially ends support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, the data highlights both encouraging progress and critical gaps in enterprise readiness across industries, geographies, and organization sizes.\n\n“While the 50% completion mark is a major milestone, it's not time to relax,” said Marcel Calef, Americas Field CTO, ControlUp. “With Windows 10 end of support just months away, organizations need to act now to avoid being caught off guard. Our data shows that the rate of migration is uneven, and many enterprises still face significant hardware and planning challenges.”\n\nIndustry Disparities Highlight Readiness Gaps\n\nControlUp’s analysis of over one million enterprise endpoints shows that Education and Technology sectors are leading the migration, with 77% and 73% of their devices already running Windows 11, respectively. In contrast, Healthcare (41%) and Finance (45%) are falling behind. A deeper look reveals that 19% of Healthcare endpoints need to be replaced entirely before they can support Windows 11, compared to just 3% in Finance.\n\nAmericas Trail Behind Europe and Other Regions\n\nBy region, the Americas are furthest behind, with only 43% of enterprise endpoints upgraded to Windows 11, even though 87% of those devices are Windows 11 ready. Europe leads all regions at 70% completion, followed by other global regions at 66%. These regional differences could impact multinational organizations’ ability to maintain consistency and security across their environments.\n\nLarger Enterprises Facing the Greatest Hurdles\n\nControlUp’s data also reveals that very large organizations (with over 10K Windows devices) are the least prepared for the end of Windows 10 support, with just 42% of migrations completed. These organizations often have complex IT environments and a higher volume of legacy hardware, making early assessments and planning essential.\n\n“ControlUp’s Windows 11 readiness assessment tool helps IT teams instantly evaluate endpoint compatibility, identify upgrade opportunities, and flag devices needing replacement, all from a single dashboard,” Calef added.\n\nThe Windows 11 Readiness report, available through ControlUp’s Windows 11 Readiness Assessment tool, is built into the ControlUp for Desktops solution—designed to improve the digital employee experience across physical and cloud-based endpoint devices.\n\nControlUp’s findings are based on a sample set of more than one million enterprise Windows endpoint devices under management as of June 2025.

    "title": "Tumor Growth Accelerated by Macrophages' Cytokine Amplification in Drosophila",
    "url": "https://www.genengnews.com/topics/cancer/dying-cancer-cells-engulfed-by-macrophages-hijack-immune-responses-to-speed-tumor-growth-preclinical-study-finds/",
    "text": "Credit: Marcin Klapczynski/Getty Images\n\nBy studying what happens when macrophage immune cells encounter dying cancer cells in tumors, scientists at Nagoya University have discovered a mechanism that accelerates tumor growth.\n\nWhen cancer cells begin to die within tumors, they expose signals on their surface that indicate they are dying. Macrophages then detect these signals and engage in phagocytosis, where they eat the dying cancer cells. Using Drosophila fruit flies as a model organism, the scientists found that this triggers production of specific cytokines, which activate growth signals in remaining cancer cells.\n\nThese cells then produce more cytokines, causing an unexpected chain reaction that promotes tumor growth. Headed by Professor Shizue Ohsawa, PhD, at Nagoya University’s Department of Biological Science, the team showed that blocking this pathway, by preventing the macrophages from phagocytosing dying cancer cells or by stopping cytokine production, significantly reduced tumor growth.\n\nOhsawa noted that targeting this interaction between macrophages and dying cancer cells could be a new way to treat cancer in humans: “Because the molecular pathways between fruit flies and humans are evolutionarily preserved, understanding these mechanisms could explain why some cancers with high cell death rates can still grow aggressively and lead to improved treatments.”\n\nSenior author Ohsawa, together with first author Eri Hirooka, a PhD student at the Graduate School of Science at Nagoya University, and colleagues, reported on their study in Current Biology, in a paper titled “Macrophages promote tumor growth by phagocytosis-mediated cytokine amplification in Drosophila.” In their paper the team concluded, “Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of non-autonomous tumor progression, whereby dying oncogenic cells activate the phagocytic function of macrophages, traditionally regarded as a tumor-suppressive mechanism.”\n\nThe complex interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, including inflammatory cells, immune cells, and fibroblasts, are increasingly recognized as key drivers of tumor progression, the authors noted. Among these stromal cells, tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the main group of phagocytic immune cells. “Their presence correlates with tumorigenesis, limited therapy response, and poor prognosis in most solid tumor types, yet the causal mechanisms remain unclear,” the team wrote.\n\nThe cellular immune system in Drosophila mainly comprises hemocytes, the most abundant subtype of which are plasmatocytes, described by the authors as professional phagocytic cells that, similar to macrophages in vertebrates, “engulf microbes, cellular debris, and foreign bodies, and also initiate humoral immune responses by secreting inflammatory cytokines.” And similarly to mammalian TAMs, the team pointed out, hemocytes have been shown to promote neoplastic tissue growth in Drosophila. “However, the mechanisms by which oncogenic cells cause hemocytes to exert non-autonomous influences, thereby driving tumor growth, remain largely elusive.”\n\nFor their reported study the team turned to genetically modified Drosophila. “We used genetically modified fruit flies to study cancer because their immune system is similar to ours, and they offer a powerful model system for research in the laboratory,” Hirooka said. “We created tiny tumors in their eye tissue and used fluorescent markers to track cancer cells and macrophages in real-time under microscopes.”\n\nTo understand how these cells interact, the researchers turned genes on and off, added or removed specific proteins, and measured the effects on tumor growth. They observed macrophages consuming dying cancer cells and measured the cytokine signals being produced during this process.\n\nThey discovered what they described as “unexpected cell-cell interactions” between mature phagocytic plasmatocytes and oncogenic RasV12/scrib cells, a well-established Drosophila model of malignant tumors. Their studies showed that when macrophages in fruit flies consume dying cancer cells, they produce an inflammatory cytokine called Upd3, a protein similar to human IL-6. This Upd3 activates JAK and STAT proteins inside living cancer cells.\n\nThese proteins normally coordinate immune responses and tissue repair, but cancer cells hijack this process: They turn on genes that make them produce their own Upd3, enhancing JAK and STAT activation and promoting tumor growth. “We observed that mature plasmatocytes phagocytose caspase-activated RasV12/scrib cells within these tumors,” they wrote. “Notably, through this phagocytic interaction, mature plasmatocytes secrete the inflammatory cytokine Upd3, thereby inducing the expression of upd genes and the activation of JAK/STAT signaling in RasV12/scrib tumors, ultimately promoting their growth.”\n\nThe researchers then found that when they genetically decreased the macrophages’ ability to consume dying cancer cells, or decreased Upd3 production, tumor growth was significantly reduced. The results challenge the assumption that enhancing immune cell phagocytosis is always beneficial in cancer treatment—many therapies aim to boost immune cell activity, but this research shows that could backfire.\n\nThe results indicated that cancer cells are more cunning than expected. Instead of just receiving growth signals from immune cells, they actively boost those signals by producing their own Upd3. The findings, the team noted, suggest that RasV12/scrib tumors co-opt this conserved cytokine amplification mechanism, which is normally activated during infection, tissue repair, and regeneration, to accelerate their own growth. “Such ‘hijacking’ of an immune-regulatory mechanism may represent a critical strategy for tumor progression, driven by complex interorgan communication.”\n\nThis mechanism may be universal across species because the dying cancer cells that start the whole process are commonly found in tumors, especially in advanced cancers."

    "title": "The Switch 2 Pro Controller Makes a Comfortable Upgrade, but Still Falls a Bit Short",
    "url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-switch-2-pro-controller-makes-a-comfortable-upgrade-but-still-falls-a-bit-short/",
    "text": "The Switch 2 Pro Controller is a standalone controller that pairs with the new Switch 2 and provides a more comfortable gaming experience than the standard Joy-Cons. While it might look similar to the old model, the second-gen controller has a number of new features to help it earn that \"Pro\" title.\n\nThe 2 Pro retails for $85 -- a pretty significant jump over the original's $70. The good news is that, if you want to save some money, the Switch 1 Pro Controllers do work on the Switch 2. Since it's detached, it's really more useful when playing docked, connected to a TV. I really like the look and feel of it, but it's definitely an expensive, unnecessary accessory.\n\nSwitch Pro Controller (left) next to Switch 2 Pro Controller (right) Sean Booker/CNET\n\nBoth Pro controllers feel pretty similar, which is good since I always felt the original was very comfortable. They're the same size and shape, and the button layout is mostly the same, but the original has a subtle texture to its grip while the 2's is smooth. I actually find the new controller a bit more comfortable than the first.\n\nJust like the new Joy-Cons, there is a GameChat button near the bottom, a shortcut to screen-sharing gameplay and forming parties with your friends to video or voice chat together. Keep in mind that you can just pop back out to the Switch main menu and open GameChat manually without needing to hit the button.\n\nGR/GL back buttons Sean Booker/CNET\n\nAnother new feature are back buttons on the underside of the handles, GL and GR. Back buttons -- programmable buttons that you can assign to act like other inputs -- are pretty standard on pro-style controllers but were absent on the first Switch Pro. For example, in shooters, players will often bind duck or jump so they can perform those actions without taking their thumb off the right stick.\n\nMapping these buttons is super easy through the Switch 2's settings menu or by holding down the Home button and changing them there. These button maps are also saved on a per-game basis, which is great, allowing you to specify which actions you want available on different games instead of needing to adjust back and forth when you swap games.\n\nDualSense Edge (left), Switch 2 Pro Controller (middle), Xbox Elite 2 (right) Sean Booker/CNET\n\nThe downside is that there are only two buttons, one on each side, like PlayStation's DualSense Edge pro controller. I would have liked more options, like the Xbox Elite controller's four programmable buttons. Both those controllers also allow you to swap the buttons' shapes. Nintendo doesn't.\n\nAnother upgrade on the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a headphone jack on the bottom, which is useful if you're trying to play games quietly.\n\nSean Booker/CNET\n\nBattery life remains the same as the first Pro Controller: Around 40 hours on a single charge, which is definitely on the higher side for controller batteries. In comparison, the DualSense Edge lasts only 5 to 6 hours. The new Pro Controller also charges faster. Nintendo says it takes about 3.5 hours for a full charge, whereas the original Pro Controller takes six hours.\n\nWatch this: Review: The Switch 2 Pro Controller 04:26\n\nThe large face buttons and analog sticks feel the same, which is good since the original didn't need improvement. The D-pad, though, feels like it has more freedom of movement and accuracy. This makes hitting diagonal inputs easier to pull off, like in Street Fighter when a special move requires a quarter circle. I found it simply better for adjusting character movement in a 2D platformer, like Super Mario Wonder.\n\nOne of my major complaints is that it still lacks analog triggers. This feature has been on Xbox and PlayStation controllers for years and allows games to sense when you partially press a trigger. It's important in racing games, for example, where pressing the trigger determines how much you'll accelerate. But nope, that's not a thing for the Switch 2 Pro Controller.\n\nSean Booker/CNET\n\nCuriously, the new Pro Controller can't wirelessly connect it to a PC. Steam doesn't yet recognize it, though it took a while before the original was directly supported as well. While it's missing some key pro features compared to Xbox and PlayStation's offerings, those controllers also retail for around $200, so the price difference makes sense.\n\nThe Switch 2 Pro Controller is best for someone who primarily games with the console connected to a TV. It's an overall improvement on the first one and brings Nintendo closer to what we expect from a pro-style design, but it becomes a harder sell if you already have the original Pro Controller. Many of the new features -- back buttons, a headphone jack, quick access to gamechat -- are pretty easy to live without, in my opinion."

Max Eberl and Christoph Freund are focused on new signings for the time being. Upamecano’s future remains unclear. There have already been several discussions between the club and the French international’s management. Initially, it seemed like a quick agreement would be reached. From a sporting perspective, everything seemed to be settled, but then the talks stalled because of money – Upamecano wants his strong performances this season to be rewarded, especially after the big contracts Davies, Musiala and Kimmich had received. In addition, Upamecano’s camp wants to include a release clause. Talks have been more difficult in recent weeks, even though both sides are interested in a contract extension in principle. No further meetings will take place for the time being. Negotiations will resume after the transfer window.\n\nThis is not great news for Bayern Munich, but also not the end of the world. As of now, it seems like both sides are intent on getting a deal done, but might need extra time to align on a salary.

    "url": "https://www.techzine.eu/news/applications/132555/microsoft-fixes-outlook-bug-that-caused-crashes/",
    "text": "Microsoft has fixed a bug that caused Outlook (classic) to crash when opening emails or starting a new message. The solution to the problem is available in several ways, although users of older versions of classic Outlook will have to wait a little longer.\n\nMicrosoft has now fixed the problem. Fixes have already been rolled out for Current Channel Preview, Monthly Enterprise Channel, Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel, Outlook 2021, and Outlook 2024. For users of Outlook 2016 and 2019, non-security updates are scheduled for July 1 and 8, respectively.\n\nThe bug affected users who installed the latest update to Outlook from Microsoft 365 earlier this month. The problem arose because Outlook was unable to open the Forms Library. “Opening or starting a new email causes classic Outlook to crash,” the Outlook team acknowledged last week when the bug was explained. Virtual desktop infrastructure proved to be a common environment for the problem.\n\nTemporary solution available\n\nUsers who are unable to install a fix can implement a temporary workaround themselves. This involves manually creating the missing FORMS2 folder at the location C:Users\\AppDataLocalMicrosoftFORMS2.\n\nThe steps are as follows: close Outlook and other Office applications, then start Start > Run, type %localappdata%Microsoft, and accept the pop-up notification. In File Explorer, create a new folder called FORMS2. After restarting the app, everything should work properly again.\n\nMore recent fixes\n\nThe fixes come after a series of other Outlook issues that Microsoft has resolved in recent weeks. A service update was rolled out to prevent Outlook LTSC 2019 from crashing when opening emails from Viva Engage, Yammer, and Power Automate.\n\nMicrosoft regularly has to tinker with its own email client due to new problems. For example, there was a notable problem for users in Current and Beta channels at the end of last year. This involved mailbox folders flickering and moving when items were moved to the folders after updating to Outlook version 2505. The fix seemed to solve this problem at the time, but that was not the case for all users.\n\nIn addition, there was one instance where the classic Outlook client was completely inaccessible. Microsoft will eventually force this change, just as Windows 10 is on its way out. However, Microsoft is currently being lenient with a free year of extra updates until October 2026 if a backup is made. This means that the switch to both Outlook (new) and Windows 11 can still be prevented."

    "text": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 will make its official debut on July 9, 2025, at the Galaxy Unpacked event. Samsung’s clamshell-based foldable smartphone is one of the most popular foldable smartphones due to the premium build, advanced features, and powerful performance. However, several competitors have emerged, compelling Samsung to upgrade. Therefore, this year South Korean giant is expected to bring significant upgrades to Galaxy Z Flip 7 in comparison to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 model. Therefore, know the upgrades we can expect and how Samsung plans to compete with other foldables.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs Galaxy Z Flip 6 Design and display: Samsung has reportedly made several design refinements to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, which makes it better than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. For starters, we can see a bigger cover display from 3.4-inch to 4-inch. The crease of the foldable display panel is expected to be nearly invisible. Therefore, we can expect a refined hinge in comparison to the predecessor. Lastly, the main display is also expected to be increased from 6.7 to 6.85 inches. However, both models may support the Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X display, providing pleasing visuals and smooth navigation.\n\nPerformance: For performance, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor paired with 12GB RAM and up to 512GB internal storage. However, this year, there may be a change of plans as Samsung may ditch Snapdragon chips for the flip series. Reports suggest that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will likely be powered by the in-house Exynos 2500 chip, with a similar 12GB of RAM storage.\n\nOne UI 8 and battery upgrade: Instead of the new One UI 7, Samsung may include the new One UI 8 based on Android 16 out of the box. This may bring new features and a refined user experience for a foldable device. While the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will also get the update after the launch. Additionally, we may also get new AI-powered features. There are also rumours about the battery upgrade for the Galaxy Z Flip 7. This year, Samsung may bring a 4300mAh battery, up from a 4000mAh battery Galaxy Z Flip 6."

    "url": "https://www.earth.com/news/mammals-tried-different-ways-to-move-before-walking-upright/",
    "text": "For over a century, scientists have debated how mammals shifted from sprawling like reptiles to walking upright. This transition marked one of the most significant events in vertebrate evolution. It shaped how mammals, from bats to humans, move through their world.\n\nWhile earlier views suggested a simple step-by-step progression, new research suggests a very different path.\n\nA study led by Dr. Robert Brocklehurst of the University of Reading shows that upright posture evolved through a complex branching process.\n\nEvolution of upright posture in mammals\n\n“The evolution of mammals has previously been characterized as a series of steps from sprawling, to semi-sprawling, to upright,” said Dr. Brocklehurst. “However, what we discovered was a more nonlinear evolutionary progression throughout mammalian history.”\n\nThe researchers analyzed over 200 species of tetrapods. They compared humerus bones across fossilized synapsids and modern animals like salamanders, reptiles, monotremes, and upright mammals.\n\nThe team examined traits such as bone length, torsion, bending strength, and muscle leverage.\n\nRather than showing a clear ladder of progress, the data revealed bursts of change. Different mammalian ancestors experimented with varying forelimb functions. These experiments shaped the eventual rise of upright walking.\n\nMapping the mechanics of movement\n\nThe researchers used a computational model to connect bone shape with function and posture. They created adaptive landscapes that linked bone mechanics to different walking styles – sprawled or upright.\n\n“By correlating bone shape and limb biomechanics with posture, we could test how well the fossil bones were optimized for specific functional tasks, like upright walking versus sprawled walking,” said Dr. Brocklehurst.\n\n“We expected to see a neat progression – from sprawling pelycosaurs to a bit more upright therapsids, then cynodonts, then fully upright mammals. Instead, we found bursts of innovation.”\n\nThe team discovered that while early synapsids did have sprawling limbs, they didn’t function like modern reptiles.\n\n“They’re not just copies of reptiles, but distinctive animals in their own right that are a little different from anything that’s alive today,” said said Dr. Kenneth Angielczyk of the University of Chicago.\n\nMammals tried many movement styles\n\nThis research challenges the idea of direct, staged transitions. Instead of rigid postural categories, the ancestors of mammals explored many forms of limb use.\n\n“Previous hypotheses posit the synapsid ‘sprawling-parasagittal’ transition as a series of discrete postural shifts; our study supports the view of synapsid evolution as a series of successive radiations, with major clades exhibiting considerable functional (and postural) variation,” the researchers wrote.\n\n“While the ancestors of mammals did generally get more upright as time went on, there was a lot of variation in each major group of mammalian ancestors.”\n\nProfessor Stephanie Pierce of Harvard University noted that the path to upright posture wasn’t a straight line. “The ancestors of mammals weren’t steps on a ladder with modern mammals at the top.”\n\nMuscles behind mammalian motion\n\nThe upright posture of modern mammals required deep musculoskeletal changes. This included shifts in bone shape and how muscles interacted with the skeleton.\n\nThe study showed that parasagittal posture – the fully upright limb arrangement – appeared relatively late in mammal history.\n\n“Our work challenges the idea that posture changed gradually and early on,” said Professor Pierce. “Instead, it shows that upright posture and locomotion were a late evolutionary innovation, not an early defining trait of the mammalian lineage.”\n\n“Understanding how mammals came to walk upright isn’t just about bones. It’s about uncovering the dynamic history of life on Earth,” said Dr. Brocklehurst.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge some limitations in their study. These include uncertainties in evolutionary timelines and divergence dates. However, the large dataset and mechanical modeling provide a strong framework for future research.\n\nTracing upright posture in mammals\n\nTo compare hundreds of bones from vastly different animals, the team had to innovate. Traditional shape analysis tools failed. So, they retooled an R software package into a “slice-based” landmarking system.\n\nThis approach allowed for precise measurement of traits even across species separated by millions of years. Former undergraduate Magdalen Mercado helped assemble the dataset, contributing to the massive scope of the project.\n\nProfessor Pierce reflected on the legacy of Harvard researchers who tackled similar questions decades ago. “Now, with new tools and data, we can revisit those ideas and see the story more clearly.”\n\n“This delayed acquisition [of upright posture] ultimately laid the foundation for the extraordinary ecological success of mammals,” said Pierce.\n\nNew chapter in mammalian evolution\n\nThis study is the first of its kind to use large-scale biomechanics to trace mammalian posture. It reveals that upright walking didn’t come early, but evolved after numerous experiments in movement.\n\nAs the team continues modeling limb function in fossil species, they aim to unlock more details about how ancient creatures lived and moved.\n\n“The origin of upright mammalian posture is a key part of their evolutionary story,” said Dr. Brocklehurst.\n\n“People have been working on this problem for over 100 years. We knew we needed to see as many fossils as possible, and really get to grips with bone function and mechanics, not just shape.”\n\nWith this broader view, scientists now see evolution not as a tidy path, but as a dynamic landscape full of surprises.\n\nThe study is published in the journal PLOS Biology.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

    "text": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nMeerKAT 1.3 GHz view of LMC SNR J0450–709. Credit: Smeaton et al., 2025.\n\nAn international team of astronomers has employed various satellites and ground-based telescopes to perform multiwavelength observations of a supernova remnant known as SNR J0450.4−7050. Results of the observational campaign, published June 18 on the pre-print server arXiv, yield new insights into the properties of this remnant, finding that it is much larger than previously thought.\n\nSupernova remnants (SNRs) are diffuse, expanding structures resulting from a supernova explosion, which usually last several hundred thousand years before dispersing into the interstellar medium (ISM). Observations show that SNRs contain ejected material expanding from the explosion and other interstellar material that has been swept up by the passage of the shockwave from the exploded star.\n\nStudies of SNRs beyond the Milky Way are crucial for understanding their feedback in different evolutionary phases and gaining insights into their local ISM. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is one of the galaxies that has its SNR population explored in detail.\n\nSNR J0450.4−7050 is a large supernova remnant in the LMC with a physical dimension of 332 by 244 light years. The remnant is estimated to be about 45,000 years old and showcases a complex filamentary morphology with distinct inner and outer shell structure.\n\nA group of astronomers led by Zachary J. Smeaton of Western Sydney University in Australia, decided to take a closer look at SNR J0450.4−7050 using mainly the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and MeerKAT radio telescope, but also a set of other ground-based observing facilities and spacecraft.\n\nThe new observations detected previously unseen faint filamentary structures extending out of the north and south of SNR J0450.4−7050, increasing the extent of this remnant to 489 by 264 light years. Therefore, Smeaton's team nicknamed the SNR \"Veliki\", which means \"large\" in Serbian.\n\nFurthermore, the observations found that Veliki has an unusually high radio surface brightness and has one of the lowest average radio spectral indices, when compared to other SNRs of similar size. A bright hydrogen-alpha shell has also been identified, suggesting predominantly radiative shocks.\n\nTrying to explain the unusual properties of Veliki, the astronomers investigated several theoretical scenarios. According to them, the most plausible explanation is that Veliki is a fully radiative SNR and the flatter spectral index and brighter surface brightness is attributed to a higher compression ratio.\n\n\"This is most likely an older, predominantly radiative SNR with a higher shock compression ratio, which gives a flatter non-thermal spectrum, in combination with a thermal (bremsstrahlung) emission contribution,\" the researchers conclude.\n\nHowever, further observations of Veliki, especially those focused on its environment, are required in order to confirm this hypothesis and to fully constrain the nature of this remnant.\n\nWritten for you by our author Tomasz Nowakowski, edited by Sadie Harley , and fact-checked and reviewed by Andrew Zinin —this article is the result of careful human work.

    "text": "Stars can throw high‑energy tantrums. Their sudden bursts of X‑ray and ultraviolet light, known as solar flares if they come from the Sun and stellar flares when they happen on other stars, pump out streams of charged particles that race across space.\n\nA new study shows that a single stellar flare can rearrange the atmosphere of an Earth‑size exoplanet within days, warming some layers, cooling others, and kicking up winds strong enough to redraw cloud belts.\n\nThe work suggests that a similar, if weaker, tug may also show up in regional weather on Earth.\n\n“This study highlights an underexplored but important solar‑climate link,” said Dr. Assaf Hochman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, lead author of the modeling effort.\n\nUnderstanding stellar flares – the basics\n\nStellar flares are explosive bursts of energy released from the atmospheres of stars, caused by the sudden reconfiguration of magnetic field lines.\n\nMuch like solar flares on our own Sun, these eruptions emit high-energy radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, including ultraviolet, X-rays, and sometimes radio waves.\n\nHowever, stellar flares often dwarf their solar counterparts in both intensity and frequency – especially on young, magnetically active stars.\n\nThese outbursts result from the build-up and sudden release of magnetic energy in the star’s outer atmosphere, typically in regions where intense magnetic loops twist and reconnect.\n\nRed dwarf stars, in particular, display some of the most violent stellar flares observed to date. Because these stars are smaller and cooler than the Sun, they compensate by having stronger and more chaotic magnetic fields, which frequently trigger energetic flares.\n\nThese events can dramatically increase the star’s brightness in a matter of minutes and pose significant challenges to the habitability of surrounding exoplanets by stripping away atmospheres or flooding surfaces with harmful radiation.\n\nSolar flares and exoplanet weather\n\nA space weather event begins when magnetic knots on a star snap and accelerate plasma into space.\n\nFlares on small red dwarfs often pack a punch: Kepler observations show average energies around 10³⁵ erg, orders of magnitude above a typical solar flare.\n\nThe new study used a three‑dimensional general circulation model to simulate TRAPPIST‑1e, a tidally locked world that keeps one face toward its star.\n\nAfter each simulated flare, the model tracked minute‑by‑minute changes in temperature, chemistry, and wind.\n\nUpper atmospheric nitrogen oxides radiated heat away, dropping the thermospheric temperature by up to 180 °F, while water vapor and nitrous oxide trapped infrared light below.\n\nThis event also lifted the temperature in the lower mesosphere by 50 °F. Night‑side winds roared past 90 mph, well above the calm baseline.\n\nFlares shift winds on exoplanets\n\nThe chain reaction starts high above the planet. Incoming protons split molecular nitrogen, spawning odd‑nitrogen species that trigger ozone loss.\n\nOzone erosion opens a window for ultraviolet light to reach deeper layers, altering heating rates and shifting pressure patterns.\n\nIn the model runs, the most active flare sequence stripped 80 percent of stratospheric ozone within eight simulated years, echoing earlier one‑dimensional results that predicted near‑total depletion under repeated M‑dwarf flares.\n\nWith its ultraviolet shield thinned, the planet’s mesosphere warmed and expanded, accelerating east‑west jets.\n\nSuch flare‑induced wind bursts of roughly 40 m/s match gravity‑wave‑driven surges seen in high‑resolution Earth models following strong solar proton events.\n\nEarth also reacts to flare events\n\nEarth has a robust magnetic field and a thicker ozone layer than most modeled exoplanets, yet violent space weather, like solar flares from the Sun, already leaves fingerprints here.\n\nGeomagnetic storms in 2003 cooled the middle stratosphere by 0.9 °F over the tropics and nearly 4 °F over Antarctica.\n\nDuring the Halloween solar proton event of the same year, nitric oxide injections heated the polar mesosphere by up to 18 °F.\n\nDr. Hochman’s team argues that similar, shorter‑lived anomalies could surface in modern reanalysis once forecasters fold real‑time proton data into weather models.\n\nSolar flares shape exoplanet habitability\n\nHabitability is more than an average surface temperature. Steady access to liquid water, stable chemistry, and tolerable ultraviolet doses all hinge on how often, and how violently, a host star erupts.\n\nThe new simulations show that even if a planet sits in the classical habitable zone, a busy flare schedule can shove it into a “moist greenhouse” state, with stratospheric water vapor levels exceeding 0.1 percent by volume.\n\nAnalyses suggest that such moisture would accelerate hydrogen loss and could desiccate a world in a few hundred million years.\n\nStill, solar flares are not universally bad. High-energy particles from solar flares can fix atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates on exoplanets and may drive prebiotic chemistry on young planets, as proposed for the early Earth.\n\nBetter models and new missions\n\nModeling limitations remain. Flare spectra were assumed to radiate like 9,000 K blackbodies, yet recent Hubble data place some M‑dwarf events above 14,000 K, which would alter photolysis rates.\n\nTemporal resolution is another hurdle. Real flares unfold in minutes, but daily time steps smooth peak particle fluxes; resolving sub‑hour pulses could sharpen predicted ozone losses.\n\nFinally, upper atmospheric coupling was cut at about 90 miles.\n\nExtending models into the thermosphere and magnetosphere will clarify how exoplanet magnetic fields modulate particle deposition, a factor shown to be decisive in long‑term ozone recovery.\n\nAstronomers will soon test these ideas. The James Webb Space Telescope already hints at weather‑scale variability in exoplanet transit spectra, and future direct‑imaging missions such as NASA’s Habitable Worlds Observatory aim to watch entire planetary disks for day‑to‑day changes.\n\nIf solar flares can stir exoplanet skies this quickly, forecasters may need to add real‑time stellar monitoring to the checklist for life‑friendly worlds.\n\nThe study is published in The Astronomical Journal.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

    "text": "UK astronomers and software developers have created an infrastructure to process and distribute petabytes (PB) of information from a digital camera that could capture an image of a golf ball 384,000km away.\n\nUsing “the largest digital camera in the world”, the Vera C Rubin Observatory is carrying out an astronomical survey of the entire available southern sky every few nights to create a timelapse movie of the universe. It published its first images earlier this week (23 June 2025).\n\nThe observatory, named after the astronomer who first proposed the existence of dark matter in the universe, sits in Northern Chile, but the data it produces is being sent to UK datacentres, where it is processed and made accessible to scientists.\n\nAbout 20 research software engineers and computational scientists, in various places, are involved in the UK part of the project, which includes cleaning data to make it science-ready, providing access to the data to astronomers and providing them with alerts.\n\nBy the end of the 10-year survey, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) project will have produced about 200PB of science-ready data and have an entire archive of about 500PB.\n\nRubin Observatory stands on Cerro Pachón in Chile against a sky full of star trails in this long exposure night sky image\n\nThe observatory is primarily funded by US research agencies the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, said computational scientist George Beckett, programme manager at Edinburgh University, who is overseeing the tech infrastructure for the UK’s role in the LSST project.\n\nWorld’s biggest digital camera He told Computer Weekly: “They have basically built the world’s largest digital camera and mounted it on a very innovative mirror design for the telescope, to allow it to capture the sky very quickly.” The camera can cover the whole southern sky in just three or four nights and get an image quickly, allowing repeat observations of each part of the sky and changes to be identified. The LSST Camera installed on the Simonyi Survey Telescope at NSF–DOE Vera C Rubin Observatory The project expects to image each patch of sky around 800 times over 10 years to make a “really deep sensitive image”. “By accumulating lots of images and the light that’s captured by them, we can look back about 1.2 million light years, which is further than we have been able to delve before,” said Beckett. It could potentially see things that have never been seen before, such as very small asteroids and similar objects in the solar system, and potentially various stars that are too dim to be seen by other telescopes or observation facilities. “They are also hoping to catch lots of very exciting changes that happen around us. One of the most interesting ones is exploding supernovae, which are the death of certain stars,” added Beckett. “It’s designed to cover a whole range of different applications, everything from understanding the making of dark energy and dark matter, to cataloguing asteroids of around the 20- to 40-metre size, which are interesting in their own right, but also potential threats to the Earth.” This illustration depicts NSF–DOE Vera C Rubin Observatory capturing light from supernovae, the explosive deaths of massive stars The observatory can do this through a camera with extremely high resolution, effectively 3.2 gigapixels. “It might be the most high-resolution camera ever built and [in size terms] it could image a golf ball on the surface of the moon.” Over the 10-year project, the UK will host one of three international data facilities and process around 1.5 million images, capturing around 10 billion stars and galaxies. When complete, the full survey is expected to rack up as much as 500PB of data.\n\nComputationally intense The UK team is contributing to the software and computational science aspects of the project. This includes cleaning the raw images that come from the telescope camera by removing, for example, atmospheric distortion and systematic noise from the telescope. This, according to Beckett, is “computationally intensive, taking millions of computing hours”. External view of the LSST Camera on the vertical lift platform during its installation on the Simonyi Survey Telescope at the Vera C Rubin Observatory The UK team is using the same computing systems that are used for the Large Hadron Collider. The US and France are also contributing to this part of the project. Data is divided into two categories. “Hot data” is what the astronomers need to access on-demand, while “cooler data” is used for more strategic campaign-based processes, where a science community takes a large amount of data and moves it to a high-performance computer system, such as Archer2 in the UK. Beckett said the team is currently building some “very large disk arrays” that will house data that requires on-demand access, while tape will be used for data that, although very important, isn’t being used every day, or is only used at certain times.\n\nOn-demand community access In the UK, a science portal for the international community is capable of connecting around 1,500 astronomers with the UK Digital Research Infrastructure to support the exploitation of data. “We’re running what’s called a data access centre,” said Beckett. The team installing the LSST Camera on the Simonyi Survey Telescope In the previous generation of computational astronomy, a scientist would typically download datasets they were interested in to their local computer. But now, via cloud platforms, the LSST project in the UK is providing access to the data, which is hosted in Edinburgh and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire. Astronomers want to be able to access all of the data for data mining or machine learning-type applications. “What we do is called ‘bring your computers to the data’, so the data is all hosted in Edinburgh or Rutherford Appleton, and we have cloud platforms that sit very close to it. Astronomers can log in, and they have all the tools and software that they need to access the data,” said Beckett. The Edinburgh datacentre, which is called the Advanced Computing Facility, is the home of the Archer2 supercomputer. There are four machine rooms. In machine room one, the UK team is building a cloud system called Somerville, named after the Scottish astronomer Mary Somerville. These exciting First Look images show that everything is working well and reassure us that we have a decade’s worth of wonderful data coming our way, with which UK astronomers will do great science Bob Mann, University of Edinburgh/LSST:UK “[Machine room one] will be both where we host the data and the compute resources that sit alongside that. And it’s very much an on-premise cloud. So, it looks like what you might get from AWS [Amazon Web Services] or Google, but it’s all running in a datacentre in Edinburgh,” said Beckett."

    "text": "Using the stars for navigation was once a common practice, particularly among sailors and nomads. Today, most navigation is handled by modern technologies like GPS. But some creatures still rely on the stars for their long nighttime journeys.\n\nThe Bogong moth (Agrotis infusa), native to Australia, is known for its remarkable long-distance migrations. It uses a combination of celestial navigation and Earth’s magnetic field to locate a destination it has never visited before: the cool caves of the Snowy Mountains, a mountain range in New South Wales.\n\n3 View gallery Bogong moth ( Photo: Ajay Narendra, Macquarie University )\n\nA new study published in Nature—conducted by an international team of scientists from Lund University, the Australian National University (ANU), the University of South Australia, and other global institutions—has shed light on one of nature’s great migratory mysteries, involving around four million moths annually.\n\n“Until now, we knew that some birds and even humans can use the stars to navigate long distances, but this is the first time it’s been proven in an insect,” said zoologist Prof. Eric Warrant of Lund University. “The Bogong moth is exceptionally accurate. It uses the stars like a compass over vast distances, adjusting its flight direction based on the season and time of night.”\n\nEach spring, billions of Bogong moths emerge from breeding grounds across southeastern Australia and fly up to 620 miles to a small number of caves and rock shelters in the Australian Alps. There, they enter a dormant state in cool, dark crevices for the entire summer. In fall, they make the journey back to breed and die.\n\n3 View gallery A wall full of resting moth ( Photo: Prof. Eric Warrant )\n\nUsing advanced flight simulators and brain monitoring in controlled, magnetically neutral environments, the researchers tested how the moths orient themselves under various night sky conditions. When shown a starry sky with no magnetic field, the moths consistently flew in the correct seasonal direction—south in spring, north in fall. When the sky was rotated 180 degrees, the moths corrected their orientation accordingly. But when shown distorted star maps, they became confused and disoriented.\n\n“This proves they aren’t just flying toward the brightest light or following a simple visual cue,” said Prof. Warrant. “They’re reading specific patterns in the night sky to determine geographic direction, much like migratory birds do.”\n\nGet the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play : https://bit.ly/4eJ37pE | Apple App Store : https://bit.ly/3ZL7iNv\n\nWhen the stars were obscured by clouds, the moths switched to relying on Earth’s magnetic field alone to maintain their course. This dual-compass system allows them to navigate reliably even in poor visual conditions. The team also identified specialized neurons in the moth’s brain that respond to the starry sky’s orientation. These cells, located in brain regions responsible for navigation and flight control, were most active when the moths faced south.\n\n“This kind of tuning shows that the Bogong moth's brain encodes celestial information in a surprisingly sophisticated way. It’s a remarkable example of the complex navigation capability required in the brain of a tiny insect,” Prof. Warrant explained.\n\n3 View gallery ( Photo: Prof. Eric Warrant )\n\nThe study’s authors suggest the findings could inspire new technologies in robotics, drone navigation, and wildlife conservation—especially for species at risk due to habitat loss or climate change. In recent years, Bogong moth populations have declined significantly, underscoring the need to protect both their migratory corridors and the dark skies they depend on.\n\n“It’s not just about moths—it’s about how animals read the world around them. The night sky has guided human explorers for millennia. Now we know it guides moths too,” said Prof. Warrant.\n\n“It’s an amazing achievement for Bogong moths, which rely on the night sky for their long journeys—even though their brains are smaller than a grain of rice,” added Dr. David Dreyer of Lund University. “It’s astonishing that a creature with such a tiny brain can do this.”"

    "url": "https://www.azorobotics.com/News.aspx?newsID=16067",
    "text": "Researchers have developed a nature-inspired magnetic soft millirobot capable of locomotion and real-time environmental sensing. As detailed in Nature, the robot uses a micro conical leg matrix and triboelectric-enhanced sensors fabricated through high-speed jet printing and magnetic alignment. Equipped with machine learning, it adapts to different terrains and tracks its own physical state without relying on magnetic surfaces.\n\nStudy: Magnetic soft millirobot with simultaneous locomotion and sensing capability. Image Credit: P. Fromentin/Shutterstock.com\n\nBackground\n\nSoft robots take cues from biological organisms to achieve flexibility and adaptability, making them promising for tasks like surgical procedures or structural inspections. Magnetic actuation allows for contactless, precise control, but most existing designs struggle with unreliable leg structures and a lack of integrated sensing, limiting their effectiveness in complex, real-world environments.\n\nThis study addresses both issues by introducing an inchworm-inspired millirobot that combines robust motion with embedded sensing. Using a precise jet-printing and magnetization method, the researchers created a uniform microconical matrix for enhanced locomotion and integrated triboelectric sensors. The design supports two-way movement, load carrying, and navigation through tight spaces, while producing electrical signals that feed into a machine learning model for surface recognition.\n\nFabrication and Characterization\n\nThe robot is built from a composite ink containing nanoscale ferroferric oxide, microscale NdFeB particles, PTFE nanoparticles, and silicone rubber, blended through planetary mixing. This ink is jet-printed onto a PVC substrate in hemispherical droplets, then magnetically shaped into a microconical matrix.\n\nTwo magnetized layers are joined using silicone rubber, with silver and indium tin oxide electrodes added for sensing. The movement layer features microcones spaced at 1300 µm and 1280 µm in height, mimicking legs, while the sensing layer uses a denser configuration (500 µm spacing, 700 µm height) to boost triboelectric output.\n\nPrinting conditions included 100 V pulses, 250 kPa backpressure, and 120 Hz frequency at room temperature (25 °C). The structure was analyzed via SEM, microscopy, and profilometry, while rheology, viscosity, and electrical output were measured using contact-separation and bending modes.\n\nFor terrain classification, a temporal perceiver network processed time-series voltage signals via FFT and multi-scale convolution. Data from five surface types—sandpaper, wood, plastic, and paper—was used to train and test the system with 80:20 data splits and a 25-point sliding window.\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe resulting robot moves bidirectionally at speeds up to 1.4 mm/second under a 100 mT magnetic field and supports loads up to five times its weight. Its triboelectric sensor outputs 7.92 V during contact and 2.4 V when bent, maintaining performance across 12,000 cycles.\n\nA major advancement is the robot’s ability to simultaneously move and sense its environment. The integrated system identifies terrain types with 96.7 % accuracy using a machine learning model. It also navigates tight spaces as narrow as 3 mm while tracking internal deformation through voltage changes, from 0.3 V to 0.15 V.\n\nThe use of magnetically shaped microcones allows for rapid customization and prototyping. By merging actuation and sensing, the researchers have developed a scalable approach for soft robots designed for constrained, unstructured environments.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study introduces a soft, magnetic millirobot that combines movement and sensing in a compact, scalable form. Its design enables it to crawl in both directions, carry loads, and recognize terrain through triboelectric signals—all while navigating gaps as small as 3 mm. The microconical matrix serves a dual purpose as both legs and sensors, streamlining the system’s functionality.\n\nLooking ahead, future work will aim to incorporate wireless communication, enhance three-dimensional control, and improve durability for practical use in areas like pipeline inspection or environmental monitoring.\n\nJournal Reference\n\nZeng, W., Ding, X., Jin, Y., Liu, B., Zeng, R., Gong, F., Lou, Y., Jiang, L., & Li, H.

    "text": "On June 3, NASA’s Perseverance rover faced off with a particularly puzzling piece of Martian geology—a rock the team dubbed “Kenmore.” Although the rock appeared ordinary at first glance, it proved to be anything but.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPerseverance attempted to grind away a small circular patch on Kenmore’s surface to study its interior minerals. But as deputy project scientist Ken Farley put it, “Kenmore was a weird, uncooperative rock.” Instead of yielding smoothly, it shuddered and flaked, forcing the team to tread carefully to extract usable data. Thankfully, just enough material was removed to press on.\n\nUnderneath Mars’ dusty façade, rocks like Kenmore hold chemical time capsules that can reveal ancient planetary processes—if you can get past the stubborn exterior. That’s where the rover’s powerful abrading tools come in, especially its gaseous Dust Removal Tool (gDRT). Unlike older rovers that used brushes, Perseverance blasts nitrogen gas to clear dust, avoiding earthly contamination. So far, it has puffed 169 times, with about 800 blasts still in its tank.\n\nOnce Kenmore’s surface was exposed, the rover’s science arsenal sprang to life. The WATSON camera captured close-ups, SuperCam fired rapid laser bursts to analyze the vaporized dust, and both SHERLOC and PIXL instruments dove into the mineral chemistry. The verdict? Kenmore hosts classic clay minerals and feldspar, and for the first time in the mission, a manganese hydroxide mineral.\n\nPerseverance triumphs over challenges to unveil Mars’ geological secrets\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThat last discovery thrilled scientists. Clay points to ancient water activity, while manganese minerals might hint at more complex geochemical processes, possibly influenced by past microbial life or unique atmospheric conditions.\n\nKenmore’s odd resistance offered more than scientific insights—it provided valuable lessons for Mars exploration logistics. “Not all Mars rocks are created equal,” Farley noted. “Studying Kenmore gives us a better playbook for future missions—for sampling, fuel production, or even building Martian habitats.”\n\nThe rover didn’t rest on its rocky laurels. On June 19, it smashed its autonomous driving record, gliding 411 meters across Jezero Crater’s rim. That’s 4.5 football fields of red dust under its wheels.\n\nAs Perseverance rolls on, every stubborn stone and sudden find brings us closer to decoding the Red Planet’s deep past—and planning a smoother future for explorers yet to come."

    "text": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nIllustration of the self-illuminating biosensor: A metasurface of gold nanowires drives quantum light emission and concentrates the resulting light waves to detect biomolecules. Credit: 2025 Ella Maru Studio/BIOS EPFL CC BY SA 4.0\n\nOptical biosensors use light waves as a probe to detect molecules, and are essential for precise medical diagnostics, personalized medicine, and environmental monitoring.\n\nTheir performance is dramatically enhanced if they can focus light waves down to the nanometer scale—small enough to detect proteins or amino acids, for example—using nanophotonic structures that \"squeeze\" light at the surface of a tiny chip. But the generation and detection of light for these nanophotonic biosensors requires bulky, expensive equipment that greatly limits their use in rapid diagnostics or point-of-care settings.\n\nSo, how do you make a light-based biosensor without an external light source? The answer is: with quantum physics.\n\nBy harnessing a quantum phenomenon called inelastic electron tunneling, researchers in the Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory in EPFL's School of Engineering have created a biosensor that requires only a steady flow of electrons—in the form of an applied electrical voltage—to illuminate and detect molecules at the same time.\n\nThe work has been published in Nature Photonics in collaboration with researchers at ETH Zurich, ICFO (Spain), and Yonsei University (Korea).\n\n\"If you think of an electron as a wave, rather than a particle, that wave has a certain low probability of 'tunneling' to the other side of an extremely thin insulating barrier while emitting a photon of light. What we have done is create a nanostructure that both forms part of this insulating barrier and increases the probability that light emission will take place,\" explains Bionanophotonic Systems Lab researcher Mikhail Masharin.\n\nTrillionth-of-a-gram detection\n\nIn short, the design of the team's nanostructure creates just the right conditions for an electron passing upward through it to cross a barrier of aluminum oxide and arrive at an ultrathin layer of gold. In the process, the electron transfers some of its energy to a collective excitation called a plasmon, which then emits a photon.\n\nTheir design ensures that the intensity and spectrum of this light changes in response to contact with biomolecules, resulting in a powerful method for extremely sensitive, real-time, label-free detection.\n\n\"Tests showed that our self-illuminating biosensor can detect amino acids and polymers at picogram concentrations—that's one-trillionth of a gram—rivaling the most advanced sensors available today,\" says Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory head Hatice Altug.\n\nA dual-purpose metasurface\n\nAt the heart of the team's innovation is a dual functionality: their nanostructure's gold layer is a metasurface, meaning it exhibits special properties that create the conditions for quantum tunneling, and control the resulting light emission.\n\nThis control is made possible thanks to the metasurface's arrangement into a mesh of gold nanowires, which act as \"nanoantennas\" to concentrate the light at the nanometer volumes required to detect biomolecules efficiently.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter—daily or weekly.\n\n\"Inelastic electron tunneling is a very low-probability process, but if you have a low-probability process occurring uniformly over a very large area, you can still collect enough photons. This is where we have focused our optimization, and it turns out to be a very promising new strategy for biosensing,\" says former Bionanophotonic Systems Lab researcher and first author Jihye Lee, now an engineer at Samsung Electronics.\n\nIn addition to being compact and sensitive, the team's quantum platform, fabricated at EPFL's Center of MicroNanoTechnology, is scalable and compatible with sensor manufacturing methods. Less than a square millimeter of active area is required for sensing, creating an exciting possibility for handheld biosensors, in contrast to current table-top setups.\n\n\"Our work delivers a fully integrated sensor that combines light generation and detection on a single chip. With potential applications ranging from point-of-care diagnostics to detecting environmental contaminants, this technology represents a new frontier in high-performance sensing systems,\" summarizes Bionanophotonic Systems Lab researcher Ivan Sinev.\n\nMore information: Jihye Lee et al, Plasmonic biosensor enabled by resonant quantum tunnelling, Nature Photonics (2025).

    "text": "WASHINGTON — Muon Space has released the first thermal infrared images from its FireSat Protoflight satellite, marking a milestone for the company’s dedicated wildfire detection constellation. The images, captured using a six-channel multispectral infrared instrument, demonstrate the satellite’s ability to detect and measure thermal signatures from space.\n\nThe satellite, built by the California-based startup Muon Space, launched March 14 aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-13 mission. The first light images show urban heat islands and airport runway activity in Sydney, Australia; lava fountains at Hawaii’s Kīlauea volcano; and gas flares at Libya’s Sarir oil field complex.\n\n“These first light images confirm that our IR sensors are operating as designed and collecting high-quality data,” said Dan McCleese, chief scientist of Muon Space.\n\nUnlike visual cameras, the FireSat sensor sees heat. Every pixel in the image corresponds to a temperature reading on the ground. That allows it to detect everything from subtle shifts in water temperature to the roaring heat of active volcanoes — and crucially, the telltale signs of an emerging wildfire.\n\nKīlauea volcano in Hawaii as seen by FireSat Protoflight’s multispectral infrared sensors.

At full operational capacity, the satellites would provide 20-minute revisit times globally.\n\nThe FireSat constellation seeks to address limitations in current wildfire detection methods, which typically rely on ground reports, aircraft patrols, or general-purpose satellites with limited temporal and spatial resolution. The constellation will serve first responders, land management agencies and research institutions studying fire behavior and climate impacts."

    "text": "GuardVibe limits high-frequency torsional oscillation to extend bottom hole assembly run life\n\nProprietary software system optimizes GuardVibe deployment for the unique needs of each well\n\nHOUSTON and LONDON - June 26, 2024 –Baker Hughes, an energy technology company, announced Thursday the launch of the GuardVibe™ torsional vibration dampener, a new approach to limiting the impact of high-frequency torsional drill string vibrations. Through its unique, field-proven approach, GuardVibe can extend the service life of bottom hole assemblies (BHA), reduce capital costs and limit unplanned downtime for operators.\n\nUnlike traditional approaches that have focused on managing bit-induced stick-slip, GuardVibe uses internal inertia mass to counteract the effect of torsional vibrations. By removing previous mechanical and electrical failure mechanisms, this design eliminates the reliability concerns of existing solutions.\n\n“The ability to drill longer horizontal wells and laterals is critical for today’s operators, but challenging formations can test the limits of BHAs,” said Greig Russell, vice president of well construction at Baker Hughes. “GuardVibe takes a new approach to a problem that has vexed the industry for decades, and the results are helping customers achieve higher rates of penetration, improved efficiency, and better control in demanding environments - all while expanding their drilling envelope.”\n\nGuardVibe is deployed as part of a holistic BHA system, and Baker Hughes’ proprietary software program is used to optimize the overall BHA design. By tailoring the system for the unique demands of each well and monitoring conditions in real time, engineers are able to more effectively limit high-frequency torsional oscillation. GuardVibe is designed to work with all Baker Hughes rotary steerable applications, allowing deployment across complex BHAs.\n\nThe system has been tested on more than 350 drilling runs, primarily in the Permian Basin where long lateral wells are common. During these trials, the system eliminated high-frequency torsional oscillation during 98% of the drilling process, resulting in superior rate of penetration and weight on bit compared to BHAs with traditional vibration mitigation tools. Similar results have been recorded in other deployments in the Middle East and South America.\n\nGuardVibe is now available in select markets.\n\nAbout Baker Hughes\n\nBaker Hughes (NASDAQ: BKR) is an energy technology company that provides solutions to energy and industrial customers worldwide.

    "text": "This newest report from the PSI Working Group for Nature is the first in a series of foundational guidance documents for the global insurance industry.\n\nThe “Nature Uncovered for Insurers” series seeks to address a critical gap in guidance on nature-related assessments by providing tailored guidance for insurance underwriting portfolios.\n\nIn this first part of the series, Rooted in Risk contextualizes existing nature-related approaches across both non-life and life & health insurance business models and supports insurers in identifying which parts of their value chain may be exposed to nature-related issues and how these issues may materialize across different lines of business.\n\nBuilding on the priority actions outlined in the PSI Working Group for Nature’s inaugural report “Insuring a resilient nature-positive future”, this report aims to provide a technical basis to help insurers prepare for and conduct their own nature-related assessments, thereby strengthening their ability to identify priority areas for action and derive substantiated, appropriate and proportionate responses aligned with a nature-positive and resilient future.\n\nThe report is intended for insurance companies seeking to understand the relevance of nature-related issues to their underwriting portfolios, as well as for organizations that support them in this process. Users can engage with the report according to their respective levels of familiarity and expertise.\n\nThe second part of the “Nature Uncovered for Insurers” series entitled “Breaking Ground” will be launched later this year.\n\nAbout the PSI Working Group for Nature\n\nThe PSI Working Group for Nature (WGN) was established in May 2024. The working group is a multistakeholder platform involving insurers, reinsurers, brokers, nature finance initiatives, environmental organizations, academic institutions, insurance regulators and supervisors, and insurance associations, among others.\n\nThe working group aims to support the industry and key stakeholders in advancing risk management, underwriting and insurance strategies, approaches, practices, products, services and solutions that address nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities (DIROs) in order to contribute to achieving the mission of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030, and its vision of a world living in harmony with nature by 2050.

    "text": "The U.S. Housing agency could soon accept crypto as a reserve for home loan applications.\n\nMarket leaders projected that the update could reduce selling pressure on BTC.\n\nThe crypto sector scored another historic win this week.\n\nIn a directive on the 25th of June, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) instructed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as an asset class for single-family mortgage risk assessments.\n\nThe order signed by FHFA Director William J. Pulte allowed loans to close without requiring cryptocurrency to be converted into U.S. dollars beforehand.\n\nPart of the guidance read,\n\n“U.S. Federal Housing FHFA, hereby directs each Enterprise to prepare a proposal for consideration of cryptocurrency as an asset for reserves in their respective single-family mortgage loan risk assessments, without conversion of said cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars.”\n\nPulte added that the move is ‘historic’ for the two industries and in line with President Trump’s pro-crypto vision for America. The order would be implemented as soon as ‘reasonably practical.’\n\nUntil now, crypto holdings were largely ignored in mortgage underwriting unless liquidated into cash.\n\nBut the directive now allows crypto assets, provided they’re stored on U.S.-regulated centralized exchanges, to count toward reserve assessments.\n\nCrypto merges with TradFi – Will Bitcoin benefit more?\n\nNaturally, the update drew swift reactions from crypto leaders.\n\nFor his part, Michael Saylor, Founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), praised the crypto inclusion.\n\nFor perspective, JPMorgan Chase was the first largest U.S. bank to embrace crypto ETF for loan collateral.\n\nWith significant regulatory rollbacks from the Joe Biden era’s anti-crypto and debanking guidelines, more banks could embrace digital assets.\n\nA similar momentum has picked up in other jurisdictions as well, like South Korea and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A fully fledged global pivot could confirm Saylor’s outlook.\n\nSaylor added that the inclusion could primarily benefit Bitcoin [BTC].\n\n“Future generations will remember this as the moment Bitcoin entered the American dream.”\n\nMost industry leaders have been echoing this line of thought, where BTC is used as collateral for liquidity, instead of holders selling their stash to cover bills.\n\nIn fact, according to Hunter Horsley, CEO of digital asset manager Bitwise, this trend could eventually reduce BTC sell pressure over time.\n\nHe projected a likely maturation and tapered sell-off when BTC peaks around $130K.\n\nCharles Edwards, founder of macro hedge fund Capriole Investment, is also inclined towards Horsey’s projection. Reacting to the crypto-backed loans update, he noted,\n\n“Millions of BTC now no longer need to be sold. Big news.”\n\nOverall, the U.S. housing agency’s move could reduce future selling pressure on BTC as it becomes key collateral for securing loans and liquidity without necessarily offloading one’s stash."

    "text": "Why the Menendez brothers’ allegations of sexual abuse are being taken seriously more than three decades after they killed their parents Update: The California Department of Corrections announced on May 19 that a parole hearing set for June 13 had been postponed to Aug. 21. Erik and Lyle Menendez were resentenced to 50 years to life in prison on May 13. Lyle Menendez, second from left, and his brother, Erik, second from right, are flanked by their attorneys in Beverly Hills Municipal Court one year they shot their parents. AP Photo/Nick Ut\n\nThis story was originally published in Northeastern Global News on Oct. 22, 2024.\n\nA Northeastern University professor says the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who are serving life imprisonment for the shooting deaths of their wealthy parents in 1989, indicates a major societal shift in how male victims of childhood sexual abuse are perceived — and believed.\n\nAround the time they were convicted of first-degree murder for killing Jose and Kitty Menendez, the young men were ridiculed in newspaper columns, talk shows and even “Saturday Night Live” as being motivated by greed.\n\nBut 28 years after their sentencing, family members are calling for the brothers’ release, saying they were driven to desperation by longtime sexual abuse at the hands of their father, a well-known executive in the entertainment industry.\n\nCarlos Cuevas, Northeastern professor of criminology and criminal justice, says in the decades since the Menendez sentencing there has been growing recognition that childhood sexual abuse affects boys as well as girls.\n\nTens of thousands of victims\n\n“As time has gone by, there has been more openness about talking about abuse in general and particularly abuse of boys,” Cuevas says.\n\nEyes also have been opened by investigations and lawsuits concerning the involvement of powerful institutions in covering up the abuse of boys and young men, with the Boston Globe’s 2002 Spotlight series about the Catholic Church coverup winning a Pulitzer Prize for public service.\n\nIn recent years, the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of America have paid out billions of dollars to settle cases going back decades involving tens of thousands of victims abused as boys and young men by priests and Scout leaders.\n\n“The Catholic Church scandal probably brought it more to the forefront,” Cuevas says. “But it’s really been sort of a gradual process,” beginning in the 1980s, of recognizing that childhood sexual abuse, including victimization of boys, is a real issue, he says.\n\n“False allegations are very, very rare, so believing (victims), supporting them and keeping them safe are the things to do,” says Carlos Cuevas, professor of criminology and criminal justice. Photo by Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University\n\nThe effects of childhood sexual abuse\n\n“But in certain circumstances it is still sort of minimized in a way I don’t think it is minimized when the victim is a girl or a woman,” Cuevas says, adding that might be because of the greater number of girls and women affected by sexual abuse.\n\nAccording to RAINN, an organization that advocates for victims, one in nine girls and one in 20 boys under the age of 18 experiences sexual abuse or assault.\n\nWhether the survivor is male or female, the repercussions of sexual assault can be severe, including post-traumatic stress disorder, mood disorders, depression, anxiety and substance abuse, Cuevas says.\n\nSurvivors may also struggle with dissociative disorders, self harm and panic attacks, says RAINN.\n\nThe effects are typical of “the kind of thing you see with individuals who are survivors of sexual abuse,” Cuevas says. “And they can be particularly exacerbated by not being believed, not being supported.”\n\nExtreme physical retaliation or murder is rare, he says. “Most victims of abuse don’t kill their perpetrators. It’s not a common occurrence.”\n\nNortheastern Global News, in your inbox. Sign up for NGN’s daily newsletter for news, discovery and analysis from around the world.\n\nVictims … and killers\n\nCuevas says what complicates the Menendez case in the popular imagination is the brothers’ perpetuation of a heinous crime, gunning down their parents as the couple watched TV in their mansion’s den.\n\n“People have a tendency to label you. You’re either a victim or a perpetrator,” he says, adding that in reality you can be both.\n\n“A lot of people who commit offenses and crimes are also victims of abuse or other forms of victimization,” Cuevas says.\n\n“It’s really hard for people to understand the context around that, which is that they committed a serious crime, but they were also victims of abuse.”\n\nLyle and Erik Menendez, who were 21 and 18, respectively, at the time of the killings, may get a chance to tell their side of the story in court again, since their case is being reviewed for possible resentencing by Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón following the emergence of new evidence.\n\nAs time has gone by, there has been more openness about talking about abuse in general and particularly abuse of boys. Carlos Cuevas, professor of criminology and criminal justice at Northeastern\n\nThe evidence includes a letter purportedly written by Erik Menendez to his cousin Andy Cano referring to the abuse months before the murders occurred as well as allegations by a member of the boy band Menudo, Roy Rossello, that he was abused by Jose Menendez when he was 14.\n\nDuring the brothers’ first trials — one for each brother — their cousin Diane Vander Molen testified that when she was a teenager staying at the Menendez home, 8-year-old Lyle told her his father was molesting him.\n\nVander Molen testified that she told Kitty but never heard what if anything became of the boy’s disclosure. The trials ended in a hung jury.\n\nDuring the second trial, which ended with the life imprisonment sentencing in 1996, the prosecution alleged the abuse didn’t occur and the judge didn’t allow much evidence of the molestation to be presented, according to defense attorneys."

    "text": "is a senior correspondent for Vox, where she covers American family life, work, and education. Previously, she was an editor and writer at the New York Times. She is also the author of four novels, including the forthcoming Bog Queen, which you can preorder here\n\nThis story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox’s newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.\n\nBirthdays are supposed to be fun. You eat cake, you open presents, maybe you have a party. They can also, however, become a source of pressure and anxiety. And for many teens today, birthdays are a time when the public nature of social media and the private joys of friendship awkwardly collide.\n\nTeens often post celebratory photos or messages on their Instagram stories for friends’ birthdays, Kashika, 19, told me a few weeks ago in a conversation about kids and friendship. Then the birthday kid will reshare those posts to their own account. The number of posts you share “forms an image of how many friends you might have,” Kashika explained.\n\nKashika, a contributor to the podcast This Teenage Life, remembered seeing classmates share tons of birthday stories, and thinking, “Oh my God, they’re so popular.” Then, on her birthday, not a single person posted a story for her. “I felt really bad,” she said.\n\nThe birthday post (or lack thereof) has become a common source of anxiety, according to experts who work with kids. Teens report “feeling a lot of pressure to post for people’s birthdays, to post in a certain way, to post efficiently, effusively,” Emily Weinstein, executive director of Harvard’s Center for Digital Thriving, told me. On the flip side, teenagers worry about having enough people post on their birthdays to “signal that you have people who really care about you” or to “show that you have a sufficient number of friends,” Weinstein said.\n\nBirthday wishes are one way that teens feel pressure to “perform closeness” on social media, posting photos and messages of affection publicly “both as part of being a good friend and as a way of validating their own social acceptance and connectedness,” Weinstein and Carrie James wrote in their 2022 book, Behind Their Screens.\n\nPerforming closeness isn’t new — teens used to decorate one another’s lockers for birthdays, Devorah Heitner, author of the book Growing Up in Public: Coming of Age in a Digital World, told me (we did not do this at my school, and now I feel left out). But social media adds a new layer of labor to kids’ already fraught social lives, forcing them to make calculations about how to celebrate their friends online — and how to respond if their friends don’t do the same for them.\n\nThe pressure to post\n\nBirthdays on social media offer a whole buffet of new stressors, kids and experts told me. For one thing, posts are easier to quantify than locker decorations. “You can literally just count the likes or count the reposts,” Heitner said. “That’s very vivid.”\n\nEven posting on other people’s birthdays can be nerve-wracking, kids say. “I used to post for every friend that I had,” Divya, 19, told me. But then she realized that other kids were only posting birthday stories for friends who had posted birthday stories for them. “It felt very weird,” Divya said, because she didn’t personally care if someone had posted a birthday message for her or not.\n\nThere’s also pressure to make your birthday post reflect the level of your friendship. “If someone is your best friend, you have to make it extra special,” Divya, a This Teenage Life contributor, told me. “You have to just do it for the sake of making your friends feel special on social media.”\n\nThat pressure to craft the perfect birthday post that communicates the specialness of a friendship is part of a larger pattern, experts say. On the one hand, “social media offer compelling opportunities to validate relationships and show public support for others,” Weinstein and James write. On the other, “when so much of posting is an expectation and over-the-top compliments are the norm, being authentic can feel nearly impossible and knowing what’s authentic can be like reading tea leaves.”\n\nThe pressure to perform closeness can be exhausting and annoying, kids say. One 17-year-old, Michelle, told Weinstein and James that she’d recently gotten stressed because she liked a friend’s photo but couldn’t think of a comment right away. “I get really nervous about it too, because I have to think of something quick, and it has to be something really good,” she said. Once she’d engaged by liking the post, the clock was suddenly ticking. “There’s definitely expectations to comment on a post.”\n\nEspecially among younger teen girls, “there’s a feeling that if we are close, people should know we’re close,” Weinstein said. If they’re not representing their friendship online through likes, comments, and posts, some teens feel “they’re not somehow not doing justice to the relationship.”\n\nAs Kashika put it, Instagram stories and other social media posts become “like a declaration in society that this person is my friend.”\n\nPushing back on the pressure\n\nPerforming closeness is far from unique to teenagers — adults are doing the same thing when they post cute photos and adoring captions on their anniversaries, Heitner said. And getting fewer birthday posts than you’d like, or fewer than other people get, can feel lousy whether you’re celebrating your 14th birthday or your fortieth. After all, millennials on Facebook arguably invented birthday posting culture (and stressful birthday comparisons along with it).\n\nBut for teenagers, whose needs for social approval and inclusion are so high, an underwhelming birthday on Instagram can be especially hard, Heitner said.\n\nLuckily, teens are developing some of their own ways of coping with the pressure social media puts on their friendships. Some are just using Instagram less in general, Heitner said. “It is socially acceptable now to be a kid who’s like, ‘I don’t really like this. I barely check it.’”\n\nOthers are learning to draw a distinction between performed closeness and the real thing. Kashika felt bad “for a while” when no one posted on her birthday, she told me. But “then I thought, no, this is just part of social media,” she said. “It does not actually depict our real friendship. And then my mood got a little better.”\n\nWhat I’m reading\n\nFamilies are reporting disturbing conditions at Texas immigration detention facilities, including adults fighting with children for clean water, and a lack of medical care for a boy with a blood disorder whose feet became so swollen he couldn’t walk.\n\nThe Trump administration is reinstating some research contracts at the Education Department that were initially terminated by DOGE, including a study on how to help kids with reading difficulties.\n\nThe idea of giving kids a “’90s summer” may be a fantasy now that YouTube exists.\n\nMy little kid and I have been revisiting Arnold Lobel’s Mouse Soup, which includes stories about a lady who becomes obsessed with a rosebush growing out of her couch, and some rocks who learn the power of perspective.\n\nFrom my inbox\n\nWhen I talk to teens, I like to ask them what adults these days get wrong about young people. What don’t we understand? Now I’m posing this to you — whether you’re a kid or an adult with kids in your life, what do you think grown-ups are getting wrong? What aspects of kids’ lives today need to be demystified or explained? Let me know at anna.north@vox.com!"

Patrick Darling, from Bristol, said he ignored a number of early symptoms of the disease before they worsened and he was diagnosed at the age of 30 in 2023. MND is a degenerative condition that affects the brain and spinal cord. It can leave people unable to speak, eat or even breathe. But Mr Darling said he does not want to be defined by the disease, adding: \"It's not who I am, it's something I have to deal with.\"\n\nHe had been working on boats at the time he began to experience symptoms and his balance started to become affected. One such incident saw him fall overboard after losing his footing and it was this which led to his diagnosis. \"My life looks completely different now. I've spent a great deal of time learning instruments, singing, working on boats, painting models. I can't do them anymore and that can make you feel like you're not you anymore. \"That really is the hardest part and the biggest impact MND has had on me,\" Mr Darling said.\n\nMotor Neurone Disease Association The musician said his \"life looks completely different now\"\n\nHe was speaking after the death of former Gloucestershire and England cricketer David 'Syd' Lawrence, who was diagnosed with MND in 2024. As a musician, Mr Darling is determined to retain his sense of identity. MND has impacted his speech but advancements in technology have allowed him to continue composing music. He said: \"I use my laptop and a special software and give the music to my guitarist, and he will play it for me. \"I think that keeps me mentally strong, because I'm creating.

    "url": "https://www.avclub.com/the-bear-season-4-premiere-recap",
    "text": "[Editor’s note: The recap of episode two publishes June 27. This recap contains spoilers.]\n\nTie up those apron strings, fire those burners, and shove that trauma down deep, because it’s officially doors on another season of The Bear. After last year’s strangely listless 10-episode run, the season four premiere is a welcome return to form for a series that built its reputation on rapid-fire dialogue, big feelings, and harried chefs sweating into their béchamel.\n\nWith apologies to Coldplay, this episode is all about closing walls and ticking clocks—and with no less than five of the latter, in fact. Like the sign says: Every second counts. But the staffers of the titular fine-dining establishment are caught in a neverending time loop. We pick up the morning after the events of the season-three finale, in which Carmy confronted Chef David (Joel McHale) at the farewell dinner for the beloved establishment Ever then got smacked across the face by the Chicago Tribune’s not-so-glowing review of The Bear.\n\nBut first, there’s a trip down memory lane: In his dream, Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) is back in the Berzatto kitchen with Mikey (Jon Bernthal), noodling about the future while stirring a pot of red sauce. This is our hangdog hero before David broke his spirit, before his big brother took his own life, before he tanked his relationship with his one true love. (Whether that’s Claire Bear or the culinary arts is a matter of interpretation.)\n\nIn a feat of close-up magic, White looks years younger here—eyes bright, posture straighter, a hopeful smile lighting up his face. He’s telling Mikey why he loves restaurants so much: They’re places where people go to gather, celebrate, and feel less alone in the world. He proposes that the two of them open one of their own. “We could take care of people. We could make it calm,” he says, describing exactly what their childhood wasn’t. Mikey is all doom and gloom, brooding over his latest failed business venture and their asshole dad. But by the end of the scene, Carmy’s charmed him into feeling hopeful about the future.\n\nCarm wakes up to the sight of Bill Murray jerking out of bed in Groundhog Day. “What if there is no tomorrow? There wasn’t one today,” perpetual grump Phil Connors is grumbling into the phone. It’s a bit on the nose for Carmy’s situation, underlining that going back into that miserable kitchen day in and day out is so repetitive, he might as well be stuck in a time loop. But Harold Ramis’ existential classic is a perfect foundational text for this show: a depressed guy who’s lost his passion for life banging his head against the wall and flirting with suicide instead of changing his circumstances. But where Phil Connors is caught in a cosmic snare, Carm is gnawing his leg off in a trap he laid himself.\n\nWhen Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) comes upon her business partner in the kitchen that morning, she’s already prepared to do damage control in re: the Trib review. The gist: Though The Bear serves up creative dishes, it’s bogged down by inconsistent service, an ever-changing menu, and overall weird vibes. Syd correctly points out that Carm needs to stop telling himself the lie that he needs that chaos to work his magic; it’s not only screwing up his life, but the lives of everyone in his orbit. He promises he’ll do better, because his traumatized brain thinks he’s still talking to Chef David, not his friend and colleague who wants the best for him. What he should be focusing on, she says, is being “less miserable.”\n\nEnter Uncle Jimmy (Oliver Platt) and blunt accountant the Computer (Brian Koppelman) to bring the mood down 10 more notches. They gather the team, including Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and Natalie (Abby Elliott, her calling in from home) around the kitchen island to deliver the bad news: The business was already floundering, but the Trib review is the final nail in the coffin. Unless they can pull off a miracle, The Bear will shutter in two months’ time.\n\nTo prove they’re not screwing around, the Computer installs a digital clock in the kitchen counting down the hours, minutes, and seconds until the ax falls. Carmy swears they’ll get a Michelin star by then—a pipe dream if there ever was one. Putting a literal clock on the season is a smart corrective to the glacial pacing of season three. The queasy thrill of a time crunch is the perfect thing to awaken The Bear from its hibernation.\n\nRichie can’t always be relied upon to make smart business choices (“I blame it on my elegance,” he tells Nat when she chews him out for blowing their front-of-house budget on flower arrangements), but he knew what he was doing when he scooped up the crack trio who kept the trains moving at Ever, led by expeditor extraordinaire Jessica (Sarah Ramos), to whip the Bear into shape. Cue an ’80s-style training montage, complete with a propulsive synth beat, as the gang attempts to wrest order from the chaos before doors that evening. I broke out in hives when Jessica set up three kitchen timers and started sticking bright red Post-it notes to order cards that took too long to plate. But it’s exactly what the restaurant needs.\n\nThings don’t go totally smoothly, of course. By the end of the night, the counter is plastered in red Post-its. But Carmy doesn’t have any PTSD flashbacks, and Richie doesn’t pop a blood vessel. When it comes to The Bear, that’s not nothing. Just as Groundhog Day taught us, making it to a better tomorrow (or, for that matter, tomorrow at all) takes time.\n\nStray observations"

At one point, Lisa refers to her as her \"late mother,\" and later reads a letter Marge had written to be opened after her death, in which a youthful-looking Marge remarks that it's \"very unlikely\" she would die before her husband.\n\nThe Simpsons features flash-forward scene of Marge's funeral\n\nAfter some back and forth about Homer's living situation, Bart and Lisa reunite to bring him home, where they watch their beloved cartoon show together once more. Meanwhile, their mother watches from the clouds above.\n\n\"I'm so happy my kids are close again,\" Marge says, just before Ringo Starr appears beside her and adds, \"Love, we’ll be late for the Heaven buffet. There’s a shrimp tower.\"\n\n\"Okay Ringo,\" she replies. \"I'm just so glad that we’re allowed to marry different people in Heaven.\"\n\nIn a lighthearted moment, Marge then kisses the Beatles star.\n\nMany fans are puzzled - is Marge Simpson really dead? With the show already renewed through its 40th season, set to air in 2028–2029, viewers will have to stay tuned to find out.\n\nFor more television news click here"

Earlier in June, the Espresso singer shared art for her album, Man's Best Friend, which shows her on her hands and knees in a black minidress with a suited man grabbing her hair. The photo prompted a heated debate, with some arguing that it pandered to the male gaze and promoted misogynistic stereotypes. On Wednesday, the pop princess posted two less contentious black-and-white images of herself holding a suited man's arm, with the caption: \"Here is a new alternate cover approved by God.\"\n\nUsers responding to Carpenter's post on Instagram included fellow pop star Katy Perry, who simply replied: \"Gahahahaha.\" Man's Best Friend is Carpenter's seventh studio album and will be released on 29 August. Fans can purchase the album with either set of artwork.\n\nIsland Records The Espresso singer was criticised by some for her original album artwork\n\nThose criticising the initial artwork included Glasgow Women's Aid, a charity supporting victims of domestic abuse, which said it was \"regressive\" and \"promotes an element of violence and control\". Not everyone was against it, and some defended the singer, explaining that the image was satirical. \"There's a deeper meaning, portraying how the public views her, believing she is just for the male gaze,\" a fan wrote on X. But Heather Binning of Women's Rights Network, told the BBC that violence against women should \"never be used as satire\". Many of Carpenter's fans are young women, and Ms Binning said the imagery \"grooms girls to believe that it is a fun, casual, sexy thing to submit to men's sexual (sometimes sexually violent) desires\".\n\nOn social media, some also criticised Carpenter for the timing, suggesting the image was not appropriate given the current political climate in the US. \"Women's control over their bodies are being taken away in the US and this is kind of insensitive,\" one user wrote on Instagram.\n\n'Sell her brand'"

But for her show in Paris on a sweltering Wednesday evening, there was a shift to a new generation on the catwalk.\n\nLiam Gallagher’s son Gene, Bobby Gillespie’s son Wolf and Myles Lewis-Skelly, Arsenal’s 18-year-old midfielder and left-back, who broke into the first team in the 2024/25 season, modelled.\n\nView image in fullscreen Grace Wales Bonner’s eponymous brand is a decade old this year. Photograph: Justin Shin/Getty Images\n\nThe collection was shown in a room full of bookshelves – fitting for a brand inspired by writers from James Baldwin to Nikki Giovanni, whose poem My Tower (Pretty Little Baby) was on the show notes. Titled Jewel, it featured Wales Bonner looking at archetypes of clothing and perfecting them through her specific lens.\n\nStandout designs included a hunting jacket cut to accentuate the wearer’s waist, a tailored black suit with brown lapels and jumpers in a melange knit, worn with shorts.\n\nDifferent takes on glamour were explored, from the sequin chiffon shirt and lowslung jeans worn by Gillespie, to Lewis-Skelly’s simple silk shirt and trousers and models in tailcoats, carrying gloves.\n\nThe collection once again had that signature Wales Bonner secret sauce: clothes that felt conceptual enough for a catwalk show, but were also seriously desirable. Those in the front row were likely making mental shopping lists as the models came down the catwalk.\n\nView image in fullscreen Wales Bonner tweaked archetypes of clothing in her latest collection. Photograph: Justin Shin/Getty Images\n\nBackstage, Wales Bonner said she was thinking about “people who collect specific types of clothing, and what that wardrobe looks like”. She focused that around “mixing sports heritage and casual preppy language, and fine tailoring”.\n\nPart of the inspiration came from working on the Met Gala and its accompanying exhibition, Superfine, with the theme of Black style and dandyism. “I wanted to have some sense of continuity and think about that character,” she said. “What would they wear in a more everyday way?”\n\nShe said working with Hamilton had been particularly important. “He has been so supportive of me over the years, it’s so special for him to give me the opportunity on such a world stage. [It was a] really inspiring process, there were definitely things I took from that language.”\n\nThe milestone of the brand reaching a decade was also on her mind. “The learnings I’ve had over the last 10 years, that’s in everything I put forward and think about the future,” she said. “I feel like I’ve got enough confidence and I’ve built enough of a language and identity, we can be a bit relaxed.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Different takes on glamour were explored. Photograph: Justin Shin/Getty Images\n\nThe designer’s influence has increased over that time, along with the brand. In April, it was reported that the brand expected to end the financial year with 81% growth compared with the previous year, with revenue doubling since 2022.\n\nThe designer’s collaboration with Adidas, begun in 2020, is central to this. It has helped the sports brand boom over the past few years – everyone from Rihanna to Rishi Sunak has started wearing her popular silver and leopard print Samba shoe.\n\nThis collection moved the narrative on – it debuted a collaboration with Y-3, the Adidas label that originally started as partnership between the sports brand and Yohji Yamamoto. On the catwalk, this was seen in a tracktop and shorts, as well as football boot-like sneakers. These shoes, described by Wales Bonner as “quite iconic”, could well be the next Samba.\n\nView image in fullscreen Models walk the runway during the Wales Bonner spring/summer 2026 show. Photograph: Justin Shin/Getty Images\n\nThe opening of Balenciaga by Demna, an exhibition showcasing items created by the mononymic designer over his decade at the brand, also too place on Wednesday. Displaying designs including the leather bag that looks like the Ikea Frakta, a skirt made out of a towel and a cap with branding similar to that of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 election campaign, it demonstrated how influential Demna’s pop art-like take on luxury has been.\n\nAs he moves to a job designing for Gucci, Pierpaolo Piccioli, formerly of Valentino, will take over at Balenciaga. Piccioli was present at this opening, possibly to absorb the Balenciaga of his predecessor. His first collection for the brand will debut in October."

By Jerome Coombe\n\nTaylor Fritz overcame a late scare from #NextGenATP Brazilian Joao Fonseca on Thursday to continue his love affair with the Lexus Eastbourne Open.\n\nTheir second-round clash had been suspended due to darkness on Wednesday evening after they split sets, and Fritz quickly regained his rhythm once play resumed. The three-time champion earned an early break and attempted to serve out the match at 5-3 in the final set before Fonseca fought back.\n\n3x Champ survives 💪@Taylor_Fritz97 withstands a serious test from Fonseca, 6-3 6-7(5) 7-5 to begin his hunt for back-to-back titles at the #LexusEastbouneOpen ❗️@the_LTA pic.twitter.com/4J0NIYDpae — ATP Tour (@atptour) June 26, 2025\n\nHowever, Fritz adjusted well to the windy conditions and a determined Fonseca to prevail 6-3, 6-7(5), 7-5 after two hours, two minutes. The top-seeded American, who owns the record for most titles won in Eastbourne (2019, ‘22, ‘24), will have to lace up and return to court later on Thursday to face countryman Marcos Giron in the quarter-finals.\n\n“I’m really happy. I was really happy with the level of tennis last night, it’s a shame we couldn’t finish the match then,” said Fritz. “Coming out today, it was tough to really judge my grass-court play, there was a lot of scrapping around.”\n\nFritz was looking assured on serve throughout the final set, during which he won all 11 points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats, prior to the ninth game. Despite stumbling at the final hurdle, however, Fritz was able to draw on his grass-court pedigree, which has helped him to three triumphs in Eastbourne and a first title of the season two weeks ago in Stuttgart.\n\n“I think almost half of my career titles are on grass, which says a lot for how short the grass-court season is,” said Fritz, the nine-time tour-level champion. “I feel really confident on it, I feel like I can be serving well, taking care of service games when it’s not really windy.”\n\nThe top-seeded Fritz takes a 4-2 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into his clash with Giron. Fonseca, who is at a career-high No. 57 in the PIF ATP Rankings, earned his maiden tour-level grass-court win over Zizou Bergs in the first round. The 18-year-old will now head to Wimbledon for his debut at the grass-court major."

Whether through road trips, tournaments or international events, these loyal travellers spend big – and destinations are taking notice.\n\nAccording to UN Tourism, sports tourism already accounts for around 10% of global tourism spending and is projected to grow by 17.5% by 2030. In the US alone, it generated an estimated $114bn in 2024, bringing more than 100 million fans to venues across the country.\n\n\"It's hard to coordinate a trip with a lot of friends, but when you have the game to schedule around, it makes it a lot easier,\" said Kimberly DeCarrera, who drives her RV to Georgia Tech college football games across the US with her friends, and has also travelled to Ireland to see the team play. \"Road trips are often more fun than the home games, seeing new cities and campuses, making memories and stories with friends. Sports make it easy to have a purpose for the trip.\"\n\nNearly 44% of global sports fans travel internationally for events, rising to 56% among 16-to-34-year-olds, according to Expedia Group's Sports Tourism Study. Trip spending typically exceeds $1,500 per person, with three out of five fans staying outside of the host city – delivering broader economic impact.\n\nFrom the Olympics to F1 races, the Super Bowl to football, sports are increasingly becoming many destinations' big draw. Here are four countries actively courting fans in the hope of scoring big.\n\nUnited States\n\nWith the 2026 Fifa World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics on the calendar, the US is betting on global sports and the appeal of international travel – though stricter border enforcement from the Trump administration have some wondering if turnout will be affected.\n\nGetty Images Las Vegas hosted its first F1 Grand Prix in 2023 and will continue the annual tradition until at least 2027 (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAs the first US city to host an Olympics since 1996, Los Angeles' infrastructure is already taking shape. The new LAX/Metro Transit Center just opened, connecting the airport to two major Metro lines via a shuttle, with an automated people mover to follow in 2026. The city also will host the 2025 US Women's Open golf tournament, eight Fifa World Cup matches (including the US men's opening game) and Super Bowl LXI in 2027.\n\nMeanwhile, Las Vegas has also made substantial investment in sports – going from no major league professional sports teams a decade ago to having a National Hockey League team, a National Football League (NFL) team and a future Major League Baseball team. The city also hosted its first F1 Grand Prix in 2023 and will continue the annual tradition until at least 2027. Nearly 175,000 out-of-town visitors came for the 2024 race, generating an estimated $934m economic impact.\n\nMany of these visitors are first-timers. \"We hear from people who tell us they would have never considered visiting Las Vegas if it had not been for a sporting event,\" said Brian Yost, chief operating officer of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. While the average Las Vegas visitor spends $1,290 per trip, sports tourists spend $1,980. \"Some of that is the cost of the ticket of the sporting event that they paid for, but the remainder is a higher propensity to spend in categories like food and beverage, entertainment, gaming and hotels,\" noted Yost.\n\nOn the East Coast, Miami is investing in football. After signing Lionel Messi in 2023, Inter Miami CF is building the 25,000-seat Miami Freedom Park, set to open in 2026. The 131-acre park, complete with retail and park and plaza spaces, is expected to generate $40m in tax revenue per year. The city will host seven 2026 World Cup matches, including the Bronze Final, with up to a million visitors expected and a $1bn economic impact.\n\nSpain\n\nWith more than 60% of citizens identifying as sports fans (particularly football), Spain has some of the world's best sporting facilities and an international presence that continues to draw fans. Its sports tourism market is expected to grow to more than 13% from 2024 to $64m, according to Travel and Tour World.\n\nGetty Images From Barcelona to Madrid, football fandom runs deep in Spain (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\"I've seen how massive soccer tourism is. I may not plan trips around matches, but plenty of travellers do,\" said Vega Lopez Romero, originally from Spain and blogger at Her Asian Adventures. \"Some fly in just for El Clásico [the twice-annual match between rivals FC Barcelona and Real Madrid], others build entire vacations around a game at Camp Nou or Santiago Bernabéu. Cities like Madrid and Barcelona have fully embraced it, with stadium tours, club museums and fan zones that make fútbol feel like a cultural event. Even if you're not there for the match, the energy is everywhere.\"\n\nValencia, Spain's third-largest city, has also embraced the trend, launching a dedicated sports tourism programme in 2019 and investing more than €1.4 million in marketing and training for local businesses.\n\n\"Valencia has become a benchmark in sports tourism thanks to the dedication and attention that we offer to athletic and active visitors,\" said Paula Llobet, the city's Minister of Tourism. \"[It is] setting us apart as a destination that truly understands and caters to their expectations.\"\n\nCities like Madrid and Barcelona have fully embraced it, with stadium tours, club museums and fan zones that make fútbol feel like a cultural event - Vega Lopez Romero\n\nTwo major venues are under construction: Roig Arena, which will be Spain's largest basketball arena when it opens in late 2025; and Nou Mestalla, a new 70,000-seat stadium for Valencia CF.

(Photo Credits: X)\n\nFormer India cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar, also called the ‘Little Master,’ is counted among the few fearless batsmen. Throughout his bright career in the sport, his captaincy and unforgettable style of playing got him numerous accolades at home and even abroad. While Gavaskar has scored over 10,000 runs and several centuries in his long cricketing career, he has transcended to become an iconic brand, something that brought him much fame and fortune that he presently owns.\n\nSince his retirement, Sunil Gavaskar has caught attention with his new role as a commentator and then as a part of the ICC cricket committee. He also ventured into business, founding India’s first sports management company, Professional Management Group (PMG), in 1985. The company takes care of player management, sponsorship deals, and event organisation.

In his possession, Gavaskar has a luxurious villa in North Goa’s Assagao. The villa, which was reportedly purchased for Rs 20 crore, is designed in European fashion and is fully furnished.

    "text": "Manchester City take on Juventus in their final group stage game of the ongoing FIFA Club World Cup, targeting top spot and potentially a more favourable last-16 tie.\n\nIt was the most dominant performance of the tournament thus far from Pep Guardiola’s side last time out, as they put six goals without reply beyond Al Ain courtesy of Ilkay Gundogan, Claudio Echeverri, Erling Haaland, Oscar Bobb, and Rayan Cherki.\n\nHaving beaten Wydad AC on matchday one, the final outing of the group stage presents the toughest test of the tournament so far, with City knowing that only a win would be enough to secure top spot in Group G and a last-16 meeting with the runners-up in Group H.\n\nRico Lewis’ ban following his straight red card against Wydad has been extended by a further two matches, making him unavailable against Juventus this week as well as the last-16 tie early next week.\n\nClaudio Echeverri is set to be ruled out after the Argentine talent was spotted on crutches and wearing a protective boot around his right foot on Tuesday following an ankle injury sustained in the first-half of the 6-0 win over Al Ain.\n\nIt also remains to be seen just how much game time could be given to the likes of Ruben Dias, Rodri, and John Stones, with both central defenders yet to feature too much at the tournament due to a mixture of rest and fitness at the forefront of Guardiola’s thinking.\n\nAhead of Manchester City’s upcoming FIFA Club World Cup group stage clash against Juventus, here is how we predict Pep Guardiola will line-up his side at the Camping World Stadium on Thursday night!\n\nPredicted XI\n\nHaving rotated the goalkeepers for the last outing at the tournament, we expect the usual pecking order to return against Juventus this week with Ederson starting between the posts for Manchester City.\n\nWith Rico Lewis suspended and Matheus Nunes having put in a relatively strong performance from a right wing-back role, the Portugal international is likely to maintain that position once more this week.\n\nHaving seen a three-at-the-back system against Al Ain, anything is possible right now as Pep Guardiola tests out different formations, but we believe a trio of central defenders will be maintained this week with Manuel Akanji, Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol all starting.\n\nAnd continuing on that same theme, off the back of a hugely impressive performance against the UAE-based club in his Manchester City debut, Rayan Ait-Nouri could start once again for City at the Camping World Stadium.\n\nThings become increasingly difficult to predict the higher up the pitch you go, but having sat out of the 6-0 win over Al Ain after an impressive debut on matchday one against Wydad AC, we think Tijjani Reijnders could be handed his second start for Manchester City.\n\nOperating alongside one another, or perhaps alternating between the deep-lying six role and a number eight position, we anticipate that Nico could be issued with another opportunity to impressive any doubters.\n\nThe same uncertainty looms over the forward ranks, but with wing-backs in our prediction, we think a very fluid but more narrow attacking pairing of Rayan Cherki and Omar Marmoush could be deployed against Juventus.\n\nFor us, that leaves Erling Haaland with the lone striker role after he got his goalscoring underway at the tournament last time out with a singular strike from the penalty spot in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nStarting XI: Ederson; Nunes, Akanji, Dias, Gvardiol, Ait-Nouri; Reijnders, Nico, Cherki, Marmoush; Haaland.\n\nSubstitutes: Ortega Moreno, Bettinelli, Reis, Stones, Khusanov, Ake, O’Reilly, Rodri, Gundogan, Bernardo, Foden, Bobb, Savinho, Doku.\n\nYou can watch every single match at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States LIVE and FOR FREE exclusively with DAZN this summer!\n\nSign up now HERE for FREE access to live coverage!"

    "text": "Liverpool have taken their summer spending to about £170m with the signing of left-back Milos Kerkez from Bournemouth in a deal worth £40m.\n\nThe 21-year-old Hungary international has signed a five-year contract with the Reds.\n\nKerkez is Liverpool's third major signing of the transfer window, following the arrival of attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz and right-back Jeremie Frimpong, both from Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nLiverpool paid a club record £116m, made up of an initial £100m and a further £16m in potential add-ons, for German interntaional Wirtz and £29.5m for Dutchman Frimpong. Hungary Under-21 keeper Armin Pecsi has also arrived at Anfield for a fee of up to £1.5m.\n\n\"It's a real honour for me, a privilege to come to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world, [the] biggest club in England. I'm just really, really happy and excited,\" said Kerkez.\n\n\"After this, I'll go home and in my hometown enjoy a few days, and then I can't really wait to come back and put the training kit on and start to train and prepare for the season.\"\n\nLiverpool will also sign Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili this summer, having agreed a deal to sign him from Valencia for a fee of £25m plus £4m in add-ons last summer.\n\nIt is a major step in the career of the left-back, but Kerkez has played for a European 'super club' before.\n\nIn early 2021 he received a phone call from AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini, who convinced him to join the Serie A side.\n\nAs the 17-year-old Kerkez said at the time, you don't turn down Maldini.\n\nWith hindsight, he possibly wishes he had.\n\nThe Hungarian never started a competitive match for Milan and a year later was shipped off to AZ Alkmaar in the Dutch Eredivisie.\n\nBournemouth saw potential in the market and took a chance on Kerkez by signing him for an undisclosed fee in July 2023. The gamble paid off.\n\nKerkez started all 38 of the Cherries' Premier League games in the 2024-25 season, helping them to a club-record total of 56 points in the top flight.\n\nKerkez is now at a giant European club once more.\n\nFour years on from his arrival in Milan, will it work out for the full-back this time around?"

    "text": "Related Articles\n\nFollowing Milos Kerkez's move from AFC Bournemouth to Liverpool, football writer Ben Bloom looks at the Hungarian's incredible journey from Serbia to Merseyside.\n\nIf there is one player likely to take the upheaval of a move from AFC Bournemouth to Liverpool in their stride it is Milos Kerkez. After all, what is 200 miles when you have already traversed a continent?\n\nPrior to joining Bournemouth while still a teenager two years ago, Kerkez had already relocated from Serbia to Austria, Hungary, Italy and then the Netherlands in a determined bid to reach the upper echelons of football.\n\nThe next step was England’s south coast – and a place in the Premier League’s Fan Team of the Season – and now he has joined the reigning champions.\n\nThe man made by so much of Europe has ascended the ladder’s highest rung.\n\nEarly travels\n\nIt was in the small Serbian town of Vrbas that Kerkez’s football journey began, learning the basics the hard way on the streets alongside his older brothers Rade and Marko, who is also now a professional player.\n\n\"My brothers were tough on me,\" Kerkez told The Guardian last year. \"They would tackle me, I would fall, my skin would be cut and bleed. I realised: 'I like to do this.'\n\n\"Cars would not be able to drive down the road because otherwise our ball would hit the cars, so they had to turn around. We’re playing football now. Roadblock. They were good times.\"\n\nA more formal football education kicked in with his local side OFK Vrbas and then nearby club Hajduk Kula, before the first big relocation with his family to Austria, where he spent almost five years rising the youth ranks of the country’s most successful club, Rapid Vienna.\n\nFrom those relative giants, a move to Hungary then saw him briefly drop down to third-tier Hodmezovasarhely, and a first crack at senior football for Gyor, a club who once reached the European Cup semi-finals (in 1965) but were then playing in the second tier.\n\nKerkez was cemented as Gyor's first-choice left-back even before his 17th birthday, and interest quickly emerged from across Europe.\n\nHaving initially intended to develop where he was, a personal phone call from AC Milan sporting director and Italy legend Paolo Maldini in January 2021 prompted a change of plan.\n\n\"There was a lot of interest in me in the winter,\" Kerkez explained to Scouted a year later. \"Everything was going fast because the period was so short.\n\n\"I actually wanted to stay in Hungary to grow more physically and leave in the summer.\n\n“Two days before the [closure of the transfer] window, Maldini called me personally, and he wanted a meeting with me and my father, and we spoke, and that was a big pull for me. You know when Maldini is calling you, you are not thinking too much.\n\n“After that, it was obvious I was going to go to Milan. It was a big club, and when they want you like this, you cannot say no.”\n\nStruggles at Milan\n\nBags packed, it was onto the fourth country of his fledgling football career, but while Italy brought further evolution it also provided frustration for a young man desperate to prove himself.\n\nAfter impressing in the AC Milan youth team, Kerkez was regularly asked to train with the first-team squad alongside players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Olivier Giroud and Theo Hernandez – an experience he described as “crazy” and “the perfect way for me to grow”.\n\nLiverpool's Conor Bradley faces Milos Kerkez of AC Milan in an Under-21s match\n\nHaving only come on at half-time, he scored twice in a 2021/22 pre-season friendly against Pro Sesto on his debut first-team outing. But, with opportunities in short supply, it would turn out to be his sole senior appearance.\n\n“I expected more first-team football after that,” he admitted. “I was expecting to get a chance because I was performing better than any full-back in the Primavera [Milan’s youth team] from any team. But unfortunately, it didn’t go that way.\n\n“Maybe I deserved a chance, but every club has their philosophy, how they work with the youth, so in the end I decided because of that I wanted to leave and play adult football.”\n\nAlmost exactly a year to the day after moving to Italy, it was time to depart for foreign fields once again.\n\nNo place like home\n\nDespite interest from Germany, it was onto Netherlands that the Kerkez wagon next rolled, joining AZ Alkmaar, where he experienced European football for the first time and did enough in one season to catch the eye at Bournemouth.\n\nMilos Kerkez scores for AZ Alkmaar vs Lazio in the UEFA Europa Conference League\n\nA year later he was heading to England and the Premier League, relocating just outside Poole on the south coast with his mother Tiijana, and father, Sebastijan, who also acts as his agent.\n\nIt is thanks to his father’s family heritage that Kerkez represents Hungary internationally, breaking into the senior side for a UEFA Nations League match against England in 2022.\n\nWhile he has faced criticism from some in Serbia for not representing the country of his birth, it was while playing club football for Gyor that he received his first international call up for Hungary Under-17s.\n\n“Serbia never called,” Zerkez explained to Scouted. “Hungary shows me big respect, and that’s what I like.\n\n“They gave my family big respect from an early age and that’s unforgettable for me, so I want to give double back. From the beginning I decided that if I get to a good enough level, I want to represent Hungary’s national team.”\n\nDespite that, through all of his travels, Serbia has always remained the place he calls home.\n\nHe has built a house near where he grew up and insists he is happiest when outdoors in nature. Fishing is one of his biggest passions.\n\n“In the summer when I go [to Serbia] for a holiday I just go for three, four days, I’ll be alone in a house, maybe with one friend, chill there, chop wood, make fire, camp, fish, that’s it, no phone,” he told the Guardian.\n\nHis aspiration is to have enough land to fill a lake with fish and spend his days trying to catch them in complete serenity.\n\nOnly then would there be no need to speak any of the five languages - Serbian, German, Hungarian, English and some Italian - he has picked up on his travels."

AI Generated/Representational Image\n\nA strong, steady pulse has been found deep beneath Africa, moving like a heartbeat.\n\nThis slow movement is gradually pulling the continent apart and could one day lead to the birth of a new ocean.\n\nThat is what a group of researchers from around the world have said after studying the crust and mantle beneath Ethiopia’s Afar region.\n\nALSO READ | First glimpse of Sun’s south pole captured: Why this is a big deal\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nIn areas where tectonic plates pull away from each other, the land stretches and becomes thinner. Over millions of years, it can break apart and form a new ocean basin.\n\nMore from Explainers Pee power: How scientists have used urine to make dental implants\n\nIn this explainer, we look at what the new study shows, what the researchers found, and how this could change the continent.\n\nWhat does the study say?\n\nResearchers from the University of Southampton have found a steady, rhythmic pulse deep under Ethiopia’s Afar region, similar to a human heartbeat.\n\nThis pulse is caused by molten magma pushing against the Earth’s crust from below. Over time, this is slowly splitting the continent, and could eventually lead to the formation of a new ocean.\n\nTo understand this process, the team collected over 130 samples of volcanic rock from the Afar region and the Main Ethiopian Rift. They also used existing data and advanced statistical models to study the crust and mantle beneath the surface.\n\nActive lava spilling out of the Erta Ale volcano in Afar. Image: Dr Derek Keir, University of Southampton/University of Florence\n\nFor a long time, geologists believed that a hot column of rising material known as a mantle plume lay beneath Afar, helping pull the crust apart. But until now, the structure of this plume and how it behaves during rifting was not clearly understood.\n\nEmma Watts, lead author of the study and a geologist who worked on the research while at the University of Southampton, explained: “We found that the mantle beneath Afar is not uniform or stationary—it pulses—and these pulses carry distinct chemical signatures.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThese ascending pulses of partially molten mantle are channelled by the rifting plates above. That’s important for how we think about the interaction between Earth’s interior and its surface.\"\n\nThe study showed that the mantle plume under Afar contains chemical bands that repeat across the rift system, like a geological barcode. The spacing of these bands changes depending on the conditions in each section of the rift.\n\nThe research was a joint effort by experts from 10 institutions, including the University of Southampton, Swansea University, Lancaster University, the Universities of Florence and Pisa, GEOMAR in Germany, the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, Addis Ababa University, and the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences.\n\nProfessor Tom Gernon, a co-author of the study and Earth Science expert at the University of Southampton, said: “The chemical striping suggests the plume is pulsing, like a heartbeat.” He added that the way these pulses behave depends on how thick the crust is and how quickly it is moving apart.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe findings show that the plume under Afar is not fixed but reacts to the movement of the tectonic plates above.\n\nMicroscope image of a thin sliver of one of the volcanic rocks from Afar. Image: Dr Emma Watts, University of Southampton/Swansea University\n\nThe study, published in Nature Geoscience on June 25, explains how these plates affect the upward flow of hot mantle material. As the continent continues to split, a new ocean basin is taking shape, with seafloor spreading expected to continue along the entire rift over millions of years.\n\nWith the first phase of research complete, the team will now focus on studying how the mantle is flowing beneath the surface and how fast it is moving.\n\nIs the continent splitting faster than expected?\n\nIn January, Ken Macdonald, a professor at the University of California, said that the continent appeared to be breaking apart more quickly than previously thought.\n\nAccording to him, Somalia, along with parts of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania, could eventually separate from the rest of Africa, forming a new landmass with its own coastline.\n\n“What might happen is that the waters of the Indian Ocean would come in and flood what is now the East African Rift Valley,” Professor Macdonald told DailyMail.\n\nAlthough cracks are already visible along the rift, scientists believe it will still take several million years before the continent completely splits apart.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD"

Yet, it’s been raining foldables all around.\n\nWhile we’re still all waiting for the grand launch of the HONOR Magic V5 and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7, vivo walks the red carpet first with the X Fold5.\n\nLightest of ’em all\n\nIf last year’s X Fold3 was already lightweight, vivo has managed to beat its own record.\n\nFrom 219 grams, its successor is more featherweight at only 217 grams. That alone makes vivo’s X Fold5 the world’s lightest book-style foldable so far.\n\nBut that’s only for the Titanium model. The two other colorways — Clear and Pine Green — are thicker at 226 grams.\n\nEven the OPPO Find N5, its closest rival, weighs 229 grams.\n\nWhile not the thinnest (as it’s already reserved on the upcoming HONOR Magic V5 at 8.8mm), the Titanium Version of the X Fold5 is still razor thin at 9.2 mm.\n\nMeanwhile, the other two colorways are slightly thicker at 9.7mm.\n\nFor comparison, last year’s X Fold3 was 10.2mm.\n\nWhen unfolded, they’re 4.3mm and 4.55mm respectively.\n\nAll these wouldn’t be possible without the vivo X Fold5’s mighty foldable mechanism.\n\nThat’s all thanks to its hinge made of ultra high-strength FS55 steel and carbon fiber materials.\n\nSpeaking of durability, the vivo X Fold5 is also the first smartphone ever to feature four IP ratings: IP5X, IPX8, IPX9, and IPX9+.\n\nAs confusing as it sounds, IPX8, IPX9, and IPX9+ are all about water-resistance.\n\nThe most extreme IPX9+ rating means it can be folded underwater with utmost protection against wind and rain.\n\nMeanwhile, IP5X has resistance from dust disturbance.\n\nAlso, the vivo X Fold5 has a durable “anti-freeze” body that can withstand -20ºC temperature.\n\nPro-grade without the “Pro” name\n\nThis 2025, vivo has simplified its latest foldable to just a single model without the existence of a separate “Pro” version.\n\nRegardless, the vivo X Fold5 still packs pro hardware inside.\n\nIt runs Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 4nm SoC found on 2024 flagships.It’s then backed by either 12GB or 16GB of LPPDR5X Ultra memory plus options between 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage in the UFS 4.1 interface.\n\nScreen sizes are still similar like last year: 8.03-inch inside, 6.53 inches outside.\n\nBoth are LTPO 8T AMOLED displays with adaptive 120Hz refresh rate, 8,000,000:1 Contrast Ratio, 452 ppi Pixel Density, 4500 nits peak brightness, 100% DCI-P3 Wide Color Gamut, and 1.07 Billion Colors support.\n\nBattery capacity has then been bumped up from 5500mAh to 6000mAh — making it a foldable with one of the biggest battery capacities.\n\nCharging protocol still remains like last year: 80W FlashCharge.\n\nHowever, vivo brings its 40W wireless FlashCharge that was absent in last year’s base model (which only the X Fold3 Pro had wireless FlashCharge at 50W).\n\nLast but definitely not the least, its mighty triple 50MP ZEISS camera system with ZEISS T* lens coating.\n\nThere’s a 50MP f/2.05 UWA (Ultra-Wide Angle) lens with a 50MP f/1.57 VCS Bionic main camera using Sony IMX921’s 1/1.56-inch sensor.\n\nLastly, a 50MP f/2.55 periscope telephoto lens based on Sony IMX882 image sensor that’s capable of shooting optically zoomed images to 3x, up to 20x telephoto macro, and up to 100x max. Also, a color-spectrum sensor that’s absent in last year’s X Fold.\n\nBoth selfie cameras are 32MP f/2.4 shooters.\n\nICYMI, that’s a flagship-grade camera system very much akin to the vivo X200, X200s, and the recently-released X200 FE. Still a rarity among foldable smartphones.\n\nThe vivo X Fold5 runs the latest version of OriginOS 5 based on Android 15 with AI-rich features and an all-new Stage Manager-like Multitasking view.\n\nThere’s even seamless (and serious) connection to the Apple ecosystem.\n\nWhether it’s sharing photos and files via AirDrop, call and text (and iMessages) forwarding in iPhones, screen mirroring, extending, or even remotely controlling your Mac, native controls when pairing your AirPods, or even viewing your latest Activity Rings in your Apple Watch, vivo’s China-based OS all support it.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe vivo X Fold5 is available in four configurations:\n\n12+256GB = CNY 6999 (US$ 975 / EUR 840 / GBP 720 / SG$ 1250 / PhP 55,730 / INR 83,935)\n\n(US$ 975 / EUR 840 / GBP 720 / SG$ 1250 / PhP 55,730 / INR 83,935) 12+512GB = CNY 7999 (US$ 1115 / EUR 960 / GBP 820 / SG$ 1430 / PhP 63,685 / INR 95,930)\n\n(US$ 1115 / EUR 960 / GBP 820 / SG$ 1430 / PhP 63,685 / INR 95,930) 16+512GB = CNY 8499 (US$ 1185 / EUR 1020 / GBP 870 / SG$ 1520 / PhP 67,670 / INR 101,930)\n\n(US$ 1185 / EUR 1020 / GBP 870 / SG$ 1520 / PhP 67,670 / INR 101,930) 16+1TB = CNY 9499 (US$ 1325 / EUR 1140 / GBP 975 / SG$ 1695 / PhP 75,625 / INR 113,920)\n\nPre-orders run for six days.

    "text": "In a big breakthrough, the Civil Aviation Ministry on Thursday recovered, downloaded, and began analysing the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and the Flight Data Recorder (FDR)—crucial for piecing together the reasons behind the June 12 crash that killed 275 people—after the black box of Air India 171 was brought from Ahmedabad to Delhi on June 24, the government said on Thursday.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese efforts aim to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences.\n\nThe memory module was successfully accessed, and its data was downloaded at the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) laboratory under the Union Civil Aviation Ministry’s crash investigation division.\n\nAdditionally, the Crash Protection Module (CPM) from the front black box was safely retrieved, and on June 25, the memory module was successfully accessed, and its data subsequently downloaded.\n\nOn Wednesday, Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu confirmed that the black box of the AI 171 flight is still in India, and it is being probed by AAIB.\n\nThis came after reports claimed that India was likely to send the black box to the United States for data recovery as the recorder sustained heavy external damage due to the fire following the deadly crash.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSuch was the intensity that the temperature in and around the crash site reached about 1,000 degrees Celsius. This probably explains why the black box, despite being designed to survive extreme conditions, suffered such extensive damage.\n\nThe AAIB, which had been given three months to complete the probe, recovered the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) as well as the flight data recorder (FDR) two days after the crash.\n\nThe CVR, which captures audio from the cockpit, including pilot conversations, and FDR collectively form what is known as the \"black box\".\n\nDecoding the black box is significant as it would provide an in-depth insight into what led to the crash and the moments before the tragedy itself.\n\nWhile the exact reason behind the crash will only be known after decoding the black box, an aviation expert has suggested dual engine failure as a possible cause.\n\nFormer US Navy pilot Captain Steve Scheibner, in an interview with India Today, suggested that the deployment of the ram air turbine (RAT) shortly after takeoff pointed to a dual engine failure.\n\n- Ends\n\nPublished By: Ajmal Published On: Jun 26, 2025\n\nTune In"

    "text": "Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has won the backing of a judge in a copyright lawsuit brought by a group of authors, in the second legal victory for the US artificial intelligence industry this week.\n\nThe writers, who included Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, had argued that the Facebook owner had breached copyright law by using their books without permission to train its AI system.\n\nThe ruling follows a decision on Monday that Anthropic, another major player in the AI field, had not infringed authors’ copyright.\n\nThe US district judge Vince Chhabria, in San Francisco, said in his decision on the Meta case that the authors had not presented enough evidence that the technology company’s AI would dilute the market for their work to show that its conduct was illegal under US copyright law.\n\nHowever, the ruling offered some hope for American creative professionals who argue that training AI models on their work without permission is illegal.\n\nChhabria also said that using copyrighted work without permission to train AI would be unlawful in “many circumstances”, splitting with another federal judge in San Francisco who found on Monday in a separate lawsuit that Anthropic’s AI training made “fair use” of copyrighted materials.\n\nThe doctrine of fair use allows the use of copyrighted works without the copyright owner’s permission in some circumstances and is a key defence for the tech companies.\n\n“This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,” Chhabria said. “It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.”\n\nAnthropic also faces a further trial this year after the judge in its case ruled that its copying and storage of more than 7m pirated books in a central library infringed the authors’ copyrights and was not fair use.\n\nA spokesperson for the Meta case authors’ law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, said that it disagreed with the judge’s decision to rule for Meta despite the “undisputed record” of the company’s “historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works”.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company appreciated the decision and called fair use a “vital legal framework” for building “transformative” AI technology.\n\nThe authors sued Meta in 2023, arguing the company misused pirated versions of their books to train its AI system Llama without permission or compensation.\n\nThe copyright issue has pitted AI companies against publishers and the creative industries on both sides of the Atlantic because generative AI models – the term for technology that underpins powerful tools such as the ChatGPT chatbot – have to be trained on a vast amount of publicly available data in order to generate their responses.

Chhabria expressed sympathy for that argument during a hearing in May, which he reiterated on Wednesday.\n\nThe judge said generative AI had the potential to flood the market with endless images, songs, articles and books using a tiny fraction of the time and creativity that would otherwise be required to create them.\n\n“So by training generative AI models with copyrighted works, companies are creating something that often will dramatically undermine the market for those works, and thus dramatically undermine the incentive for human beings to create things the old-fashioned way,” Chhabria said."

    "title": "Throwback Thursday: I met mighty Red Rum at Cork Summer Show",
    "url": "https://www.echolive.ie/nostalgia/arid-41657777.html",
    "text": "Cork Summer Show 2025 has come and gone, and it was one of those rare occasions when the Clerk of the Weather behaved himself, the sun actually shone, and the crowds poured in.\n\nWhat memories do you have of this great annual event in our city? Do they stretch back to when it was held at the grand old showgrounds down by the Marina, or when it moved out of the city to its current location near Ballincollig?\n\nIn its earlier years, it ran for four days, and brought in competitors from all over the country, and indeed abroad.\n\nGardeners worked at their plants for months beforehand, competitive housewives refined recipes and set their lips grimly as they mixed yet another cake which this year surely would beat that from their greatest rival.\n\nSo many people were - and still are - involved and participated in the Summer Show. Tell us what you remember of this much-loved Cork occasion.\n\nThrowback Thursday reader Anita Philpott has shared with us her own treasured childhood memory of a Cork Summer Show, recalling her excitement at that time.\n\n“I am absolutely weak with excitement. Red Rum, the famous racehorse who won the Grand National three times, is visiting Cork Summer Show! All the Philpotts are thrilled at the opportunity to actually see this legendary horse in the flesh.\n\n“And this is my very first time going to the show, which goes on for four days. Liam and dad are looking at John Deere tractors. Our Massey Ferguson is getting rather rickety and shook. I would prefer a new lorry.\n\n“Dad brings pigs up to Evergreen street, in Cork, and the lorry is rather smelly. However, we are going in the red Cortina today! Happy days!”\n\nRed Rum (May 3, 1965 – October 18, 1995) was, of course, a legend in racing, a champion thoroughbred steeplechaser. He achieved an unmatched historic treble when he won the Grand National in 1973, 1974, and 1977, and also came second in the two intervening years, 1975 and 1976.\n\nHe was especially renowned for his jumping ability, having never fallen in 100 races.\n\nThe 1973 race in which Red Rum secured his comeback victory from 30 lengths behind is often considered one of the greatest Grand Nationals in history.\n\nAnd in a 2002 UK poll, Red Rum’s historic third triumph in the Grand National was voted one of the greatest sporting moment of all time.\n\nAnd he came over all the way to Cork Summer Show? Well, why wouldn’t he? He was after all an Irish horse, bred at Rossenarra stud in Kells, Co Kilkenny, by Martyn McEnery.\n\nIt was a trip back to the ould sod for the horse, and we’re sure he enjoyed every moment in his homeland, breathing that familiar air of his foalhood.\n\nHowever, disaster was hovering for young Anita Philpott at that particular Summer Show.\n\n“We eventually get to the showgrounds at around 1pm. And guess what, we have missed the whole parade with Red Rum! The tears are stinging my eyes and beginning to roll down my cheeks.\n\n“Dad is horrified. ‘Don’t worry, we will pop into the stables and say hello to him. You can have a private viewing’. Oh, isn’t my dad just brilliant!\n\nBrian Fletcher riding Red Rum to victory in the Grand National at Aintree, Liverpool, in 1973 - the horse won it three times in total\n\n“I have six sugar cubes I nicked from the kitchen. They are a bit crumbly in my jeans pocket, but no matter what, I will hold my hand out flat and Red Rum can lick the sugar off my hand. (I had, in fact, taken 12 sugar cubes, but I ate six coming up in the car.)\n\n“My dad and I go to the stable area of the Show Grounds. We find Red Rum, no security whatsoever, and we hop into the stable. He is so beautiful.\n\n“He nuzzles my hand and I rub his silky neck. I love to rub the opposite way to the hair pattern so he can get a real rub.\n\n“Along comes a rather tall, well-dressed man. Dad nearly genuflects and instinctively puts out his arm to shake the newcomer’s hand.\n\n“The man is a bit perturbed. ‘You are not supposed to be in here’. Then he spots me, and I immediately start babbling to him about my love of Red Rum. I explain that we missed the parade.\n\n“Dad starts chatting, and between the jigs and the reels they talk for easily half an hour. Dad’s knowledge and history of the race horse is pretty impressive. He was also a very successful point-to-point jockey himself in the mid-1940s, so they have a lot in common.\n\n“Eventually, Ginger McCain (for it was no other than that famous trainer) reaches into the inside pocket of his tweed jacket, goes down on one knee to me, and says ‘It was so lovely to meet you’. He hands me a pound note and a postcard of Red Rum with McCain’s autograph on it.\n\n“I am so thrilled and I can’t wait to visit grandad’s grave and tell him about it. I tell Ginger McCain how grandad would have loved to have met Red Rum. I give Red Rum a final kiss and pat and off we go. A lovely gentleman is Ginger McCain.”\n\nThat’s a remarkable memory to cherish, Anita. But her memories of that Summer Show continue.\n\n“After that excitement, I can hardly stay in the real world, but shopping comes next, and that revives me quickly.\n\n“My favourite shop in Cork (apart from the pet stores) is the joke shop. You can buy whoopee cushions, and Wrigley’s Spearmint fake chewing gum packets. That’s the one where you can take a fake gum silver rectangle out and then a trap comes down on your finger! I also love the red fish paper. You can ask it questions like ‘Will you marry a rich man’? It curls up yes to every question, which I am dodgy about. Anyway, the joke shop rocks.\n\n“They always set up a booth at the Cork Summer Show and bring all their merchandise there. These guys actually travel to all the country town agricultural shows too.\n\n“I also love the fake cigarettes that look so real and glow up at the end. They are mega- realistic and Lilah Fitzpatrick, my mom’s pal, gave me one of her old cigarette holders so I can pretend to be a grand lady from the 1930s movies!\n\n“Not strictly acceptable by today’s standards of course, but back then we never thought of things like that!\n\nAnita continues: “And eventually, sadly, the day is over. We all pile into the car and head off home over Naad and back to Kanturk.\n\n“Myself and my brother Dan compare all our shopping. Dan has a bag full of stink bombs, Mam has warned him twice that there will be blue murder if he lets any off in the car.\n\n“I have a bag full of joke toys and my treasured signed picture of Red Rum. Oh, happy days at Cork Summer Show!”\n\nThis heartwarming tale had me heading straight for the internet to find what year that was when the legendary steeplechaser made an appearance at our show. That’s funny, no hits at all. Check further, wider. Nope, nothing. How strange.\n\nBack to Anita. Can you remember what year it was, exactly? Our heroine goes into action immediately: “Hold on, I will ask my racing buddies. He was ridden through the showgrounds by the famous jockey from Castletownroche (later a highly successful trainer) Jonjo O’Neill. I think it was 1978 or ’79.\n\n“Oh, Red Rum was a massive draw. They were selling notecards, diaries, etc, on the day.\n\n“Unfortunately, we sold our family home in later years, and my bedroom was cleared out while I was in the States, so unfortunately all my mementos went too. Grr! But I promise you it is a true story!”\n\nWe didn’t doubt it, Anita, we assured her, but she was head-down on a mission to find the facts now.\n\n“I rang an organiser of the Cork Summer Show, but they just asked me ‘Who was Red Rum?’ Well! They did say they would forward my query to the show’s historian, however.\n\n“Then I looked in back catalogues on the Cork Show website, but they only had the list of the competitions.\n\n“I do think the Golden Vale creamery in Charleville might have paid for him to come, so perhaps that would not be recorded in catalogues?”\n\nAnita even tried to make contact with JonJo O’Neill, who she follows on Facebook. “Unfortunately, he is at Ascot at the moment but I am sure he will get back to me when he returns.”\n\nAnother acquaintance she could try was Eddie, who she describes as a wonderful vet in Kanturk.\n\nAn advert for the visit of Red Rum to the Cork Summer Show in June, 1980 - Murphy’s Brewery organised the visit\n\n“He would have been there that day in Cork. You would always have a lot of vets there for the show. My mum thinks it might have been 1980.\n\n“The funny thing was that I could not find a word on the internet that he had ever been to Cork, and then discovered that Eddie the vet had in fact missed the show that year. GRRR!\n\n“Even the AI chat box was a big fat ‘No’ on Red Rum coming to Cork . Then my head went ‘Maybe dad set it up?’ I know I threw a right wobbler when we missed the parade. I would not put it past him, lol! But surely I couldn’t have dreamed meeting that horse and his trainer?”\n\nDogged Anita next put an appeal out on the Cork City Golden Days group on Facebook, “and, would you believe it, within 20 minutes, two people came back with the needed confirmation of my story! Gosh, what a relief!”\n\nJoan Desmond replied to her: “I certainly remember Red Rum’s parade at the Cork Show, as I am a huge fan. He came into the ring to parade to an appreciative crowd.\n\n“I remember the announcer listing the number of Red Rum’s race wins (not just the National) and my father saying, ‘He’s a good horse so’.\n\n“I took pictures (long since disappeared) and got Ginger McCain’s autograph. I can’t remember the year exactly, possibly 1979 or ’80?”\n\nAnd Theresa Byrne helpfully confirmed not only the exact year but the exact dates: “Red Rum was at the Cork Summer Show from June 17-19, 1980.”\n\nWell thank you both, girls, for bringing your own memories to back up Anita’s delightful story of a long-ago magical day and a magical encounter. It makes all the difference when others share their memories with you and confirm that it wasn’t just your imagination playing tricks. It really did happen!\n\nThis writer had an interest in that story too, since I often met Red Rum exercising on the long beach at Southport in Lancashire when living there back in the late 1970s. I took the photo here of Red Rum on that beach.\n\nUnlike many racehorses, who tend to be jumpy and nervous, he was the most genial and friendly of equines, always willing to be stroked and made much of.\n\nRed Rum naturally was a popular visitor to summer shows over in the UK, and would stand patiently while crowds gathered round to see and touch the legend for themselves.\n\nI particularly remember admiring the way the sleek skin of his hindquarters had been combed into lozenges which caught the sun, and wondering how long it took to achieve that result.\n\n“Isn’t that amazing?,” responded Anita delightedly to my musings. “That photo is from Southport beach! So you saw him there? He really did capture everyone’s heart. I will never forget meeting him.”\n\nHave you got golden memories to share? Send them to us right now!

    "text": "The four latest generation optical satellites, developed and built by Airbus in partnership with the French Space Agency CNES are on their way to their launch pad in French Guiana.\n\nToulouse, France, 26 June 2025 – The four latest generation optical satellites, developed and built by Airbus in partnership with the French Space Agency CNES are on their way to their launch pad in French Guiana.\n\nThe satellites left Toulouse, France, for the European Space port in Kourou, French Guiana, for launch by Arianespace on a Vega-C rocket on 25 July.\n\nDesigned and built by Airbus, the CO3D (Constellation Optique 3D) dual-use satellites will deliver a global high-resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) service to CNES providing 50 cm stereo imagery as well as 2D imagery for government and commercial customers. In addition, the CO3D satellites will strengthen Airbus' solutions of optical and radar satellites.\n\n“CO3D is not only a step up in operational capability, it is also a game changer in terms of technological, industrial and commercial innovations. A partnership in French ingenuity, thanks to strong support from CNES, it will further enhance the S250: our next generation dual-use optical satellite product that is already attracting particular interest in today’s geo-political context,” said Alain Fauré, Head of Space Systems at Airbus.\n\nWeighing around 285 kg each and equipped with full electric propulsion, the four spacecraft will operate for eight years, in pairs orbiting on opposite sides of the Earth, with the satellites in each pair 100 km apart. They will be able to provide stereo imagery from a heliosynchronous orbit at 502 km altitude.\n\nThis data will feed a cloud-based ground segment operated by Airbus, including an image processing chain delivered by CNES, to produce a cutting-edge 3D map of the Earth’s landmass. This data will answer both the military need for precise and up-to-date cartography as well as civil applications such as hydrology, geology, civil security, urban planning and land and resource management.\n\nAfter six months of in-orbit testing, the satellites will take 18 months to deliver a 3D map of France and the ‘crisis arc’ to CNES. Following completion of the mapping service, the satellites will be available for other imagery missions and customers.\n\nInnovations and new technologies on the spacecraft include the LASIN, an optical laser communication demonstrator associated with an optical ground station operated by CNES. Installed on one of the four satellites, it will enable download data rates 10 times faster than what is possible with an X-band transmitter, reaching 10 gigabits per second.\n\nThe satellites have also been designed to allow customers to upload and execute an application onboard. This can include artificial intelligence and deep learning applications for the direct detection and extraction of specific items such as vessels or planes. CNES will lead the first demonstration of this new feature.\n\nCO3D will also ‘see in the dark’ thanks to its high-performance sensor equipped with a noise reduction mode. This will enable it to extend the exposure time over a particular target. Combined with an innovative control mode of the satellite, this will unlock image acquisition in low light conditions to observe dark areas such as urban areas at night.\n\nBeyond CO3D\n\nThe CO3D programme, as for subsequent S250-based satellites, benefits from the constellation satellite expertise acquired with the development of the OneWeb constellation, with standardised equipment, scale effects, strengthened supply chain and optimised production systems, such as design-to-build. The assembly line located in Toulouse was inspired from aeronautics and automotive series production and integrates end to end digitalisation of operations and smart tools.\n\nIn addition to the CO3D-satellites, the carbon monitoring spacecraft Microcarb will also be launched on the same rocket. Microcarb is a joint mission between CNES and the UK Space Agency and is equipped with a highly capable Airbus-made spectrometer to map the carbon content of the atmosphere at planetary scale, enabling climate scientists and meteorologists to better identify carbon sinks and sources."

    "text": "NASA's Curiosity rover has captured the first detailed images of a section of Mars that scientists believe offers strong evidence of the planet’s watery past.\n\nAccording to NASA, the red planet once had flowing rivers, lakes, and possibly even an ocean. However, over time, Mars lost its surface water and became the dry desert we see today. The latest images taken by Curiosity reveal striking features crisscrossing low ridges arranged in a distinctive \"boxwork pattern\" spread across several miles of a Martian Mountain. These formations, scientists say, offer dramatic evidence of ancient groundwater activity.\n\nNASA shared the images and accompanying video in a blog post on Monday, highlighting their significance in understanding Mars' climate history. The boxwork ridges are located on Mount Sharp, a mountain made up of many layers formed during different periods of the ancient Martian climate. As the Curiosity rover climbs this mountain, it is essentially exploring Mars’ environmental history layer by layer, in search of signs that water once existed and whether it could have supported microbial life.\n\nNew Terrain, New Findings\n\nThe rover is currently investigating a layer rich in salty minerals known as magnesium sulfates. These minerals typically form as water evaporates, suggesting that this part of the mountain was created during a time when Mars' climate was becoming increasingly dry. Remarkably, despite the drying conditions, the presence of the boxwork patterns shows that groundwater still existed beneath the surface, leaving behind physical changes that are visible even today.\n\nAccording to NASA, these new findings add to growing evidence that Mars once had conditions suitable for life and help researchers better understand the planet's complex geological and climatic history.\n\nAbout Curiosity Rover:"

We must embrace this shared advocacy to pursue environmental sustainability for ourselves, for our children, and for the succeeding generations,” said Legarda, who has been at the forefront of environmental legislation and grassroots programs since her first term in the Senate in 1998.\n\nArbor Day, observed every June 25 under Proclamation No. 643, promotes a nationwide movement for tree-planting.\n\nLegarda underscored that the active collaboration of the national and local governments, the private sector, and sectoral groups is key to revitalizing degraded ecosystems, protecting natural resources, and addressing the evolving climate crisis.\n\n“Since I was young, I’ve found joy and peace in planting trees. To this day, as a backyard farmer, it remains more than a hobby, it’s a responsibility I carry with deep conviction as a legislator,” Legarda shared.\n\nA staunch advocate of environmental conservation and ecological resilience, the four-term Senator continues to push for legislation on sustainable land use, biodiversity protection, and climate adaptation.\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\nAmong the bills championed by Senator Legarda are Senate Bill No. 2135, or the Barangay Greening and Forest Land Rehabilitation and Protection Act, which empowers barangays and local communities to take an active role as stewards of the environment; and Senate Bill No. 2320, or the Sustainable Forest Management Act, which seeks to strengthen the protection and sustainable management of the country’s forests and forest resources.\n\nLegarda emphasized that successful reforestation requires more than planting for the sake of numbers—it means planting the right trees, in the right places, and ensuring they survive and thrive.\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\n“Native trees, in particular, play a vital role in restoring our forests and rebuilding the health of our ecosystems. These are the species naturally adapted to Philippine climate and soil. They support local biodiversity, protect watersheds, and are more resilient in the face of disasters and changing weather patterns,” Legarda said.\n\n“Let Arbor Day inspire us that what we plant and nurture at present shapes the future we will harvest,” she added.\n\nLegarda encouraged all to join hands in tree-planting efforts, support the protection of native and endemic tree species and help cultivate a strong culture of environmental consciousness among all Filipinos."

    "text": "Australia’s competition watchdog has launched federal court action against Australian Gas Networks, alleging the company misled consumers with its “Love Gas” campaign.\n\nThe advertisements, which ran on free-to-air television, streaming and YouTube during 2022 and 2023, claimed household gas would be “renewable” within a generation.\n\nBut Australian Gas Networks did not have reasonable grounds for making that claim, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), given the significant technical and economic barriers to distributing renewable gas to households.\n\n“We allege that Australian Gas Networks engaged in greenwashing in its ‘Love Gas’ ad campaign,” the ACCC chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said.\n\n“We say these ads were intended to encourage consumers to connect to, or remain connected to, Australian Gas Networks’ distribution network and to purchase gas appliances for their homes, based on the misleading impression they would receive ‘renewable gas’ within a generation.”\n\nThe advertisements featured a young girl and her father using gas appliances in the home, with voiceovers that included “it’s becoming renewable”. Each ended with the company’s logo next to a green flame, along with the words: “Love gas. Love a renewable gas future” – with no qualifications, fine print or disclaimers.\n\n“Renewable gas” usually refers to a mix of hydrogen and fossil gas.\n\nA spokesperson for Australian Gas Networks said they were disappointed with the ACCC’s decision to start proceedings and they would defend the claims.\n\n“We always strive to provide clear and accurate communications about the role and benefits of natural gas today and renewable gas into the future,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe ACCC said it began the investigation after complaints from consumers and the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF).\n\nThe ACF chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, welcomed the ACCC’s court action.\n\n“Gas is a polluting fossil fuel that when dug up and burned releases billions of tonnes of emissions, driving global warming and dangerous climate-fuelled events like floods, fires and droughts,” she said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "text": "The large-scale, illegal commercial extraction of peat is widespread in Ireland and the sector does not operate within planning or environmental laws.\n\nThat is the main conclusion in the Environmental Protection Agency's first ever report about large-scale peat extraction in Ireland.\n\nIt has investigated 38 sites across seven counties where large-scale commercial peat extraction is taking place without any of the necessary authorisations from the local authorities\n\nThe counties are Offaly, Kildare, Tipperary, Westmeath, Roscommon, Longford and Sligo.\n\nAbout 300,000 tonnes of peat is being extracted from these sites annually, nearly all of which is being exported.\n\nIt is worth about €40 million per year.\n\nAll these sites are being operated and harvested illegally.\n\nThe EPA said they are causing catastrophic damage to local environments; decimating vital ecosystems for biodiversity, culture, and research; and destroying the country's natural carbon sinks - precious boglands that absorb greenhouse gases and are important in the fight against climate change.\n\nThe EPA has already prosecuted a number of large-scale peat extraction businesses through the courts and closed them down.\n\nHowever, many illegal peat extraction operators have been adapting to evade EPA enforcement by reducing their footprint size to below 50 hectares.\n\nThis takes them out of the direct enforcement remit of the EPA, although they remain within the enforcement remit of local authorities.\n\nWatch: EPA's Dr Tom Ryan warns over peat extraction\n\nMilled peat at the Pass of Kilbride\n\nThe report says local authorities have been conspicuous in their lack of enforcement of environmental law and their performance in this area is \"patently inadequate\".\n\nThe EPA said one large-scale peat extraction operation on a narrow country road known as the Pass of Kilbride in Co Westmeath, is typical of what is going on.\n\nThe road at this location literally bisects the Bog of Milltownpass.\n\nOn one side is an untouched bogland with all the flora and fauna of a wild place, and signs declaring its status as a designated and protected Natural Heritage Area.\n\nThe other side of this narrow public road is lined with a couple of 100m long, 3m high heaps of milled peat - soft stuff that might be spread on flower beds to help plants grow, for instance.\n\nBehind those heaps of milled peat stretches a vast brown industrial-scale scarred landscape, complete with active peat harvesting machinery.\n\nPeat harvesting at the Pass of Kilbride\n\nIt is the polar opposite of the intact protected natural bogland across the road.\n\nThe bare brown landscape on this side is 3m below the untouched bog on the far side.\n\nIt is obvious from this that large-scale extraction of peat has been going on here for years, probably decades.\n\nThe EPA says the illegal extractions are causing catastrophic damage\n\nEPA Director of the Office of Environmental Enforcement Dr Tom Ryan said: \"They would have originally taken away all of the natural environment, the surface environment, the heather and sphagnum moss, and those habitats.\n\n\"They would have lowered the water table, drained the water, and then started to mill the surface of the peat. They mill several centimeters deep each season, harrowing the peat to allow it to dry. Then gather it up to bring it away for processing.\"\n\nHe said the peat here is not being harvested as turf for fuel or for domestic use. It is being milled for the export market where it will be used for horticulture, mushroom growing, and animal bedding.\n\nThe EPA has given local authorities all its enforcement information, and intelligence about the location, size, and nature of the 38 illegal peat extraction operations, including aerial photography.\n\nIt is calling on those local authorities to step up to their statutory responsibilities as regulators, to develop county-wide enforcement plans and site-specific enforcement plans, and to then implement those plans and hold operators to account.\n\nLocal authorities have the primary responsibility for regulating all commercial peat extraction\n\nDr Ryan said that local authorities need to prioritise their resources and use the \"ample statutory enforcement tools that are available to them\" to bring these operations to a halt.\n\n\"If operators want to continue with this kind of practice, then they have to engage with the local authorities to get the appropriate authorisations, and that would mean they need planning permission if they're above 30 hectares.\n\n\"When they're above 50 hectares, they need planning permission and a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency. Sites below 30 hectares require a screening process where the question is asked, is there an environmental impact going on here and are the appropriate assessments required related to habitats potentially impacted. If the answer to that is yes, then they too also need planning permission from the local authority,\" Dr Ryan said.\n\nLocal authorities have the primary responsibility for regulating all commercial peat extraction, specifically regarding compliance with environmental legislation including the performance of Environmental Impact Assessments, Appropriate Assessments associated with protected habitats, and the granting or otherwise of the necessary planning permissions for those activities.\n\nThe EPA is directing local authorities to take appropriate enforcement actions against such operations within their jurisdiction.\n\nThe EPA said it will continue to use its powers to ensure that local authorities fully implement and enforce the environmental requirements pertaining to large-scale commercial peat extraction.\n\nWe need peat 'whether we like it or not' - Fitzmaurice\n\nIndependent Ireland TD for Roscommon Galway Michael Fitzmaurice said that until there is an alternative, we need peat \"whether we like it or not\".\n\nSpeaking on RTÉ's Today with Claire Byrne, he said a solution is needed and decisions must be made in the mean time.\n\n\"We need this for the time being, until we get solutions. Mushrooms will be needed in Ireland, flowers will be needed, other vegetables will be required,\" he said.\n\n\"People have to decide - do we want to get a solution to this or do we want to put up the big headline and decide that we're going to call everyone different things?\n\nHe added: \"We need the peat, whether we like it or not, for the next few years until we have an alternative, and when we have an alternative, the companies vote with their feet and move on,\" he added.\n\nDeputy Fitzmaurice also described a 'large scale site' as being over 50 hectares and said there is no such thing in Ireland."

    "text": "THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Agency has said that local authorities are “conspicuous in their lack of enforcement” of environmental law when it comes to operators of illegal, large-scale peat extraction.\n\nThe EPA has investigated 38 sites across seven counties where large-scale commercial peat extraction is being carried out without any of the necessary authorisations from the local authorities.\n\nThe EPA said these are “flagrant violations” of environmental law which “needs to stop”.\n\nThe seven counties are: Kildare; Longford; Offaly; Roscommon; Sligo; Tipperary; and Westmeath.\n\nOffaly is home to nine of these illegal large-scale sites subject to EPA investigations and Westmeath is home to eight, while on the other end of the scale, one of the 38 sites investigated is in Sligo.\n\nLocal authorities have the primary responsibility for regulating commercial peat extraction sites below 50 hectares and ensuring that operators comply with planning and environmental laws.\n\nMeanwhile, all sites above 50 hectares also require an EPA licence and come under the direct enforcement remit of the EPA.\n\nHowever, it is understood that some operations reduce their sites to below 50 hectares in order to come under the remit of local authorities as opposed to the EPA.\n\nThe EPA also warned in its report that illegal large-scale peat extraction is “widespread” in Ireland and that the “sector does not operate within planning or environmental laws”.\n\nIts report relates to large-scale operators and does not refer to the extraction of peat as fuel for domestic use.\n\nThe EPA added that it is not concerned with domestic cutting for turf or fuel but with large-scale, illegal extraction that is mainly for the export market.\n\nIts report found that illegal operations are contributing to an export trade of 300,000 tonnes of peat annually, valued at almost €40 million.\n\nThe seven local authorities referred to in the report must now take “appropriate enforcement action” against operators of illegal large-scale peat extraction.\n\nRegulation\n\nLarge-scale peat extraction can only take place if it is granted planning permission and in some cases, an EPA licence is also required.\n\nLocal authorities are responsible for granting or otherwise the necessary planning permissions for peat extraction, including carrying out Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and Appropriate Assessments (AA).\n\nAn EIA examines the anticipated environmental effects of a proposed project.\n\nAn AA determines whether a project could have a significant impact on protected sites such as Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas.\n\nBoth are carried out on commercial operators as part of the licensing and planning process.\n\nHowever, the EPA found that local authority enforcement in this area is “patently inadequate” and it has directed local authorities to take appropriate enforcement actions against such operations within their jurisdiction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it noted that Longford is “moving in right direction” and has employed resources and issued notices, the other six counties are said to consider the EPA requirements to be “resource intrusive” and that any action would have “questionable chances of success”.\n\nThe EPA said it will continue to use its powers to ensure that local authorities “fully implement and enforce the environmental requirements pertaining to large-scale commercial peat extraction”.\n\nThe EPA has carried out 170 enforcement inspections between 2021 and 2024 and has also taken legal actions at District Court and High Court level against operations on areas greater than 50 hectares.\n\nThese legal actions have resulted in the cessation of illegal peat extractions on several peatlands in recent years and a number of actions remain live before the courts.\n\nBut the EPA warned that local authorities have been “conspicuous in their lack of enforcement of environmental law”.\n\nDr Tom Ryan, Director of the EPA Office of Environmental Enforcement, said local authorities “need to step up to meet their legal obligations as regulatory authorities, prioritise their resources and use the ample enforcement powers at their disposal to bring these illegal activities to an end and to protect our environment”.\n\nRyan said the environmental damage caused by illegal large-scale peat operators is “catastrophic for the environment”.\n\nHe added that they result in the “destruction of vital ecosystems for biodiversity, the loss of important carbon sinks for our efforts on climate change and the decimation of an irreplaceable cultural and scientific amenity and resource”.\n\nPeatlands are capable of absorbing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and are known as “carbon sinks,” making them ideal for helping to tackle climate change.\n\nIllegal peat extraction\n\nThe EPA noted three methods of illegal large-scale peat extraction.\n\nOne such method is “milling” which involves the removal of the top few centimetres of the peatland and this milled peat is used predominantly as a peat compost in horticulture.\n\nLarge sod peat involves excavating large sods or blocks of peat from the peatland and allowing them to dry and these large sods are also used in horticulture.\n\nMeanwhile, wet peat extraction involves partially draining the peatland and the peat is “quarried” and excavated in its “wet” state.\n\nThe EPA describes wet peat extraction as the “less sophisticated and most damaging” of the methods and this material is primarily used in the mushroom growing industry.\n\nThe EPA said that a large quantity of peat extracted in Ireland has been exported all over the world and that its enforcement action has played a “major part in driving down exports of peat arising from illegal large-scale operations”.\n\n‘Excellent example of engagement’\n\nMeanwhile, the EPA report noted that “appropriate regulation of peat harvesting can provide important protections for the environment”.\n\nIt pointed to Bord na Móna as an “excellent example” of “appropriate engagement with the environmental regulations”.\n\nUp until 2020, Bord na Móna lawfully operated nine different peatland sites across 11 counties.\n\nThe extraction of peat at these peatlands has now ceased and large scale remediation programmes are underway.\n\nBord na Móna is engaged in the rehabilitation of those peatlands, with almost 19,000 hectares rehabilitated by the end of 2024, with rehabilitation works to be carried out on the remaining 14,000 hectares.\n\nThese rehabilitation works allow water levels to increase and stabilise across the peatland, providing conditions for peatland habitats and species to naturally recolonise the area."

    "text": "We are a step closer to the legendary Star Trek tricorder, a fictional device that enabled the intrepid crew of the Starship Enterprise to scan an alien planet for signs of life. Commander Data of Star Trek – The Next Generation. Photograph: CBS via Getty Images\n\nWe are a step closer to the legendary Star Trek tricorder, a fictional device that enabled the intrepid crew of the Starship Enterprise to scan an alien planet for signs of life.\n\nA recent paper by Nousias and colleagues shows how the instructions of life, contained in DNA, can be detected and analysed in greater detail than ever before from air samples.\n\nWhile environmental DNA has been collected before from water, soil, sand and even air, the team combined air samples with deep sequencing methods that recover much more detailed information on the genetic code of animals, plants, humans and microbes in the environment.\n\nThis paper has a fascinating Irish connection. Some of the tiny air pumps used to collect samples were located at the zoology building in Trinity College Dublin, the Boyne estuary in Meath and Croghan mountain in Wicklow.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThese samples were contrasted with air samples from Florida coastal and forest locations. Notable species detections in Dublin city centre included dust mites, high bacterial diversity and a substantial amount of bumblebee DNA – perhaps related to the success of Trinity’s recent campuswide actions for pollinators.\n\nDNA was also detected from plants that may be largely consumed rather than grown in the area, including peanuts, cannabis, opium poppy and the fungus psilocybe – “magic mushrooms”.\n\n[ What do changing rainfall patterns mean for the world’s nourishing grasslands?Opens in new window ]\n\nOrganisms in the environment, including humans, shed DNA into the air through the flaking of skin, production of pollen or saliva and all manner of other materials that are produced as they go about their daily lives. The materials we use and consume also shed DNA. The air is therefore a veritable genetic soup which can be sampled and the DNA sequenced.\n\nModern genetic sequencing called “shotgun sequencing” enables sequences of DNA to be produced without an initial template, so genetic surprises may be found by comparing the sequences with databases of known species.\n\nMethods such as “genetic barcoding” require that you fish in the genetic soup with a specific set of organisms in mind, and your detections are therefore limited by what you are looking for. “Shotgun sequencing” also enables you to quantify how much DNA of a particular genetic sequence is in the air sample, which means you can compare sites for the relative abundance of a particular animal, plant or microbe.\n\nOf course human DNA is also detectable. An astonishing level of detail on the genetics of human populations can be retrieved from sampling the air alone. DNA from Dublin was characteristic of a diverse international city, whereas there were much fewer genetic types in the rural samples. While individual humans were not identified in this study, the technology now undoubtedly exists to enable individual human genomes to be analysed and identified from non-invasive samples, such as the air you have recently walked through.\n\nAs with many technological leaps there are risks and opportunities for the deployment of deep sequenced environmental DNA analysis from air samples. Rapid biodiversity assessment is urgently needed to identify, monitor and manage the health of our environment. Difficult to study and detect species such as nocturnal bats and moths, low-density predators and microscopic species can be sampled using these methods.\n\nEnvironmental monitoring for detection of harmful pathogens is possible, with the potential for early-warning signals of disease outbreaks. In one week of sampling in Dublin city, 221 species with disease potential for humans were detected. Air can be scanned for the presence of allergens such as peanuts or for illegal narcotics.\n\nIt will also be possible to deploy this technology for harmful purposes, including military use, monitoring and targeting of particular human populations or individuals and the illicit sampling of natural resources in the search for new medicinal drugs. There are profound ethical consequences of large-scale genomic analysis of human populations and individuals that need to be urgently addressed and regulated.\n\nWhile the lure of the tricorder is strong, there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that the methods are robust and representative of the abundance and presence of particular species in the sample area.\n\nInternational and national-level policy and regulation needs to be developed to ensure that the benefits of rapid biodiversity assessment can be achieved with guardrails in place to prevent potentially damaging uses.\n\nYvonne Buckley is co-director of the Co-Centre for Climate + Biodiversity + Water and professor of zoology at Trinity College Dublin"

    "text": "Quantum computing engineers have brought the world a step closer to building practical, large-scale quantum computers.\n\nUNSW Sydney quantum engineers, in collaboration with University of Sydney scientists, have developed new technology that effectively reduces the size of the circuits required to run a silicon-based quantum computer.\n\nThe move paves the way for more quantum information to be packed into a smaller footprint.\n\nThe work is part of a partnership between two startups - UNSW spinout Diraq and University of Sydney startup Emergence Quantum .\n\nThe milestone, published in Nature , is a crucial step towards integrating Diraq's silicon 'quantum dot' technology with the mature processes of the semiconductor industry to achieve utility-scale quantum computers that can tackle problems with true societal and commercial value.\n\nQuantum bits (or 'qubits') must be held at cryogenic temperatures, very close to absolute zero (-273.15 °C), to preserve their information. But they also need to be controlled and measured by complex electronics built from circuits found in laptops and smart phones known as complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS).\n\nUnlike qubits, these circuits are usually designed to work at room temperature, not at cryogenic temperatures. And if they are placed close to the qubits, they can heat them, degrading their performance. The control system can be separated from the qubits by long cables, but the millions of qubits required for practical quantum computing render this solution impossible.\n\nEmergence Quantum has solved this challenge by designing 'cryo-CMOS' technology that functions at millikelvin temperatures, and together, Diraq and Emergence have now shown that this cryo-CMOS control circuitry does not compromise the performance of Diraq's qubits."

    "url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-insights/3-multibagger-stocks-to-watch-as-europe-rearms-and-india-ramps-up-defence-spending/3891574/",
    "text": "Europe is rearming, and India is doubling down on its defence commitments. In response to rising geopolitical tensions, Europe recently unveiled the ReArm Europe Plan—its most ambitious push to strengthen its military capabilities.\n\nAt the same time, India continues to scale up its defence budget, with a growing focus on indigenisation and export potential. According to ICICI Securities, this twin push—one global, the other domestic—could support a more sustained order flow for Indian defence manufacturers. For investors, this raises the question: which listed companies stand to benefit from this changing landscape?\n\nALSO READ 3 Defence stocks with fresh breakout on charts\n\nIn their report, ICICI Securities highlighted three stocks. Let’s dig into these stocks that could be worth tracking as global and domestic defence capital expenditure gain traction.\n\n#1 PTC Industries\n\nPTC Industries is one of the leading manufacturers in the engineering sector, serving the aerospace, defence, oil & gas , paper , power and marine industries. Within defence , it caters to air, land, naval, and space, as well as aero engines and civil aviation.\n\nThe company has a diversified product profile, including special castings, machined components, and fabricated parts made from metals such as Stainless Steel, Duplex Stainless Steel, Super Duplex Stainless Steel, and other high alloys.\n\nPTC has a reputed client base including Rolls-Royce, Dassault Aviation, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), the Ministry of Defence (MoD), and Israel Aerospace Industries. This has led to repeat business over the years, supporting its revenue growth.\n\nPTC has established a strong presence in the export markets, which generate more than 80% of its overall revenue. Within the export business, its revenue is diversified across countries, including Finland, Norway, the US, China, and the Netherlands.\n\nFinancials stable, margins expanding.\n\nIn FY25, total income rose 27% to ₹3.4 billion, while net profit increased by 44.5% to ₹0.61 billion. Operating margin remained stable at 32%, compared to 31.8% in the previous year. However, its return on equity (RoE) declined to 4.4% from 8.6% in FY23 due to front-loaded equity infusion.\n\nRoE is expected to recover as new capacities become operational.\n\nAcquisitions and aerospace orders boost growth potential.\n\nLooking ahead, the company is expanding its aerospace casting facility in the UP Defence Industrial Corridor . This will help it diversify its product portfolio and strengthen its presence in the defence sector.\n\nThe company also recently acquired Trac Precision, a UK-based precision engineering firm. Trac designs and manufactures precision components for the aviation, defence and power sectors. This acquisition will give PTC planning and machining capabilities it previously lacked, thereby further integrating and strengthening its operations.\n\nIn other developments, its subsidiary, Aerolloy Technologies (ATL), has successfully produced aerospace-grade titanium alloy ingots in trials. ATL supplies components used in CFM’s LEAP-1A/1B engines, which are relatively efficient & environmentally friendly.\n\nCFM International is a 50-50 joint venture between GE Aerospace (US) and Safran Aircraft Engines (France) that manufactures jet engines. Over 370 LEAP-powered aircraft are operational in India, with more than 2,000 engines on order. This offers a huge opportunity to tap into.\n\nTo this end, it has recently secured an order from SAE for seven cast aeroengine components. This strengthens ATL’s ties with a global manufacturer and supports India’s growing role in the global aerospace supply chain.\n\nThe company’s revenues are expected to grow meaningfully, driven by scale from its Trac acquisition and the ongoing facility expansion. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 341, significantly above its 10-year median of 52.\n\nPTC Industries Share Price\n\n#2 Dynamatic Technologies\n\nDynamatic Technologies manufactures highly engineered and critical products for the aerospace and defence, metallurgy and hydraulic sectors. It is one of the world’s largest producers of hydraulic gear pumps, holding a 70% market share in India’s tractor sector.\n\nIt is also a leader in high-precision airframe structures and aerospace components. The company supplies these to global aerospace companies, including Airbus, Boeing, Bell Helicopters, Dassault Aviation, Deutsche Aircraft and HAL.\n\nAdditionally, it manufactures complex, high-precision metallurgical iron castings for use in performance-critical components such as turbochargers and exhaust manifolds. Metallurgical clients include Audi, BMW, Volkswagen, and Daimler.\n\nIts diversified manufacturing facilities in India, the UK and Germany benefited it as customers sought local suppliers after the pandemic. Revenue is also well diversified. 43% of revenue comes from aerospace, 33% from hydraulics and 24% from metallurgy.\n\nAerospace drives growth as metallurgy drags\n\nFrom a financial perspective, revenue declined 1.8% over the previous year to ₹14 billion in FY25. The decline was primarily driven by a 29% fall in the metallurgical segment, due to subdued industrial demand. In contrast, the aerospace and hydraulics segments grew 19% and 2.2%, respectively.\n\nNet profit (excluding exceptional items) rose 26% to ₹0.43 billion, supported by lower input costs. Segment-wise, aerospace leads on profitability with a 26% margin, followed by hydraulics at 5.3%, and metallurgy at 3%.\n\nGrowing defence vertical\n\nLooking ahead, the company is positioned to benefit from new orders and government support for domestic defence manufacturing. Its European manufacturing base and partnerships with global companies further enhance its positioning.\n\nIn line with this, the company has inaugurated a Rear Fuselage Assembly Line for the D328eco turboprop aircraft in Bengaluru, in partnership with Deutsche Aircraft. This places Dynamatic to tap into India’s growing regional aviation sector.\n\nIt has also partnered with Airbus to manufacture all types of doors for the A220 regional jet at its Indian facilities. First-article inspections are expected to begin this September.\n\nIn the hydraulics segment, the company expects a revival driven by increased construction and agricultural activity, supported by a favourable monsoon. It is focusing on increasing aftermarket share, improving operational efficiency, and value engineering to boost margins.\n\nWithin the metallurgy segment, the company is working on cost reduction, rationalising low-margin products, and developing aerospace-grade castings and forgings, which is expected to support growth in the coming quarters.\n\nThe company trades at a P/E of 111, double its 10-year median of 50.\n\nDynamatic Technologies\n\n#3 Azad Engineering\n\nAzad Engineering is engaged in manufacturing precision-forged and machined components for the clean energy, aerospace, defence, and oil and gas sectors. The company manufactures all types of blades for both radial and axial flow applications.\n\nThe business can be broadly divided into three key areas: energy, aerospace, and oil and gas. It has long-term contracts with reputed customers in the domestic and export markets. Clients in the energy segment include General Electric, Mitsubishi, BHEL , Siemens , and Toshiba.\n\nIn aerospace, its customers include Honeywell, GE Aviation, Rafael, and HAL, among others. Export sales are well-diversified across the US, UK, Europe, Japan, and the Middle East.\n\nDefence and aerospace drive growth\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, revenue grew 33% to ₹4.5 billion in FY25. Revenue growth was driven by aerospace & defence, which grew 84%, followed by energy (26%). Oil & gas contributed 79% of overall revenue, aerospace & defence 18%, and other segments the remaining 3%.\n\nThe company now earns 92% of its revenue from exports, with only 8% coming from the domestic market. Net profit surged 51% to ₹0.9 billion, with margins expanding 180 basis points to 36.3%.\n\nLooking ahead, Azad has an order book exceeding ₹60 billion, providing revenue visibility for over a decade. These orders are scheduled for execution over 3–6 years, and the company is targeting over 30% revenue growth in FY26.\n\nAzad expects the aerospace and oil & gas segments to grow faster than the company average. Over the medium term, it estimates that energy will contribute 55–60% of revenue, with the rest from aerospace, defence, and oil & gas.\n\nCapacity expansion underway\n\nThe company is building a mega manufacturing facility, with Phase I currently under development. Phase II will commence afterwards. Once commercialised, full ramp-up is expected to take 12–18 months. The company expects an incremental asset turnover of 2x over time, from new facilities.\n\nThe company trades at a P/E of 118. It has a limited trading history, which makes it challenging to assess its valuation.\n\nAzad Engineering Share Price\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia’s defence manufacturers are well-positioned to benefit from rising global and domestic military spending. While PTC Industries, Dynamatic Industries, and Azad Engineering offer intense exposure to aerospace and defence opportunities, their valuations already reflect high growth expectations.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nNote: Throughout this article, we have relied on data from http://www.Screener.in and the company’s investor presentation.

    "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-equitable-bank-ceo-andrew-moor-death/",
    "text": "Open this photo in gallery: Andrew Moor, CEO of EQ Bank, in 2023. Mr. Moor died at age 65 over the weekend, the bank said on Tuesday.Chris Young/The Canadian Press\n\nEquitable Bank chief executive officer Andrew Moor – who built Canada’s largest challenger to the Big Six banks – died unexpectedly over the weekend at age 65.\n\nMr. Moor, who led EQ Bank as CEO for 18 years, was known for growing the lender into a major national business, and for recognizing and developing talent.\n\nThe bank confirmed his death in a statement Tuesday morning and named Marlene Lenarduzzi, the bank’s chief risk officer, as interim CEO effective immediately.\n\nMr. Moor “built a team that reflects the very best of his values – genuine, kind, capable – and leaves behind not just a legacy, but a foundation for continued success,” EQ Bank board chair Vincenza Sera said in a statement. “He led with warmth, intellect and deep humanity. He championed people, empowered them and believed in growing from within.”\n\nMr. Moor and the bank’s board had recently been working on succession planning.\n\n“This process was very advanced at the time of his passing, and the board expects to be able to announce his permanent successor in the very near term,” bank spokesperson Maggie Hall said in a statement.\n\nEQ Bank did not disclose the cause of death. Three sources said Mr. Moor is believed to have suffered a heart attack on Sunday.\n\nThe Globe and Mail is not identifying the sources as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.\n\nMr. Moor led the digital bank since 2007 and built it into a challenger to Canada’s six major lenders, with $134-billion in assets under management and administration.\n\nFinance entrepreneur Stephen Smith first became friends with Andrew Moor in 1990, when both their wives were expectant mothers, in the same prenatal group. Mr. Smith, co-founder of First National Financial Corp. subsequently became the largest shareholder in Equitable Bank, with a 20-per-cent stake.\n\n“Andrew was a visionary leader, highly strategic in the way he built Equitable and allocated capital, while hugely personable in his ability to walk around the office and motivate employees,” Mr. Smith said in an interview. “Andrew had a wonderful ability to be outspoken without being offensive.”\n\nMahima Poddar, EQ Bank’s former head of personal banking, said Mr. Moor was the reason she joined the lender in 2016 when it was still building a presence in the industry. Identifying and empowering talent was one of his greatest gifts, she said.\n\n“Andrew gave me more rope than I probably deserved at the start, but it was exactly what I needed to grow,” she said in a statement. “The wins I had at Equitable were because he backed me, gave me space and stood behind me. He created an environment where people could succeed by being themselves – a rare thing in any organization.”\n\n“His belief in me changed the course of my career – and my life,” she said.\n\nMr. Moor, who served on the executive committee of the Canadian Bankers Association, was part of the recruitment team that appointed the CBA’s current leader. When CBA CEO Anthony Ostler first met him during an interview for the top job in 2021, Mr. Moor was wearing a black blazer with a bright yellow EQ Bank T-shirt.\n\nFrom the questions Mr. Moor asked, Mr. Ostler quickly gleaned that the CEO was a “tireless advocate” for Canada’s smaller banks and wanted to ensure that the next head of the CBA would also consider the needs of these lenders.\n\n“He loved a good debate, but always with a twinkle in his eyes and a big laugh. He liked to dig into things and peel away the layers of the onions in discussions, so it was fun to have a glass of wine with him because you would always come out of it having thought about things differently,” Mr. Ostler said in an interview.\n\n“He wasn’t afraid to make waves, but always in the desire to advance things, not to break them.”\n\nSonia Baxendale, CEO of the Global Risk Institute and former head of retail banking at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, knew Mr. Moor as an industry colleague for more than two decades, and said he was confident and brave. Among Canada’s big banks, he garnered respect for his ability to push the envelope and made people pay attention to EQ Bank, she said.\n\nIn January, 2023, EQ Bank launched a credit card that allowed customers to withdraw cash for free at any automated teller machine in Canada while earning cash back and high interest. The product was first viewed as a gimmick by some people in the industry, but it quickly attracted attention from a younger generation of clients, Ms. Baxendale said.\n\n“I don’t think anybody outside of a large financial institution has had as big an impact as Andrew Moor, and his impact was only recently really becoming recognized in terms of the success of his organization and it’s market success,” Ms. Baxendale said in an interview.\n\n“He was a competitive threat to the industry and to other players.”\n\nHe was also a vocal challenger for open banking – a movement to drive innovation and customer choice in banking by creating a secure way to compel financial institutions to share a customer’s financial data at their request.\n\nSenator Colin Deacon, a leading voice among parliamentarians pushing for greater competition in banking, said Mr. Moor “showed us how to do it.”\n\n“He was struggling within the banking sector to have the regulations adjust to the future he was making,” Mr. Deacon said. “The regulations in so many ways were stuck in the past, and he just continued to fight through that in a really constructive and positive way.”\n\nAdam Felesky, co-founder and CEO of fintech venture capital firm Portage, which is an affiliate of Power Corp. of Canada, called Mr. Moor a trailblazer.\n\n“He proved that you could create a successful competitive bank offering in the Canadian market. He was a strong voice of more competition and access to critical banking infrastructure.”\n\nDaniel Eberhard, CEO of Vancouver-based digital bank Koho, said Mr. Moor was “a pioneer.”\n\n“So many of this generation of fintech builders looked up to Andrew for all he had done for the ecosystem and for Canada,” Mr. Eberhard said.\n\n“More than that though, he was kind, gregarious, and always willing to get on the phone and help.”\n\nMr. Moor is survived by his wife, his son and two daughters.\n\n“He was a family man through and through. He lit up when he spoke about his kids – always so proud, always smiling,” Ms. Poddar said. “That love, that sense of what really mattered, showed up in everything he did.”\n\nMr. Moor joined EQ Bank at the outset of the financial crisis when the lender had 107 employees, $4.4-billion of assets under administration and operated as regional trust company. It is now Canada’s seventh-largest bank and has nearly 2,000 employees.\n\n“In the early days he not only knew every employee’s name, he generally knew their partners’ names and often the kids’ names,” former EQ Bank board chair David LeGresley said.\n\nWith files from Andrew Willis and Tim Kiladze"

    "title": "A solid-state battery breakthrough may be taking shape in Maryland",
    "url": "https://www.techspot.com/news/108411-solid-state-battery-breakthrough-may-taking-shape-maryland.html",
    "text": "Forward-looking: In a quiet corner of Beltsville, Maryland, a new chapter in battery technology is unfolding. Ion Storage Systems, a company that began as a university research project, has emerged as a leading contender in the race to commercialize solid-state batteries – a technology long promised but rarely delivered at scale.\n\nAfter a recent visit to the company's Maryland facility, The Wall Street Journal concluded that Ion Storage Systems stands out as a company with a real chance of achieving this long-sought breakthrough. Backed by the US Department of Energy and private investors, Ion's batteries are now rolling off the production line, with early units already being tested by the Department of Defense and major electronics manufacturers.\n\nSolid-state batteries are often described as the holy grail of energy storage. Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, which use a liquid electrolyte and a graphite anode, solid-state batteries replace the liquid with a solid ceramic material and often use lithium metal as the anode.\n\nThis design promises a host of benefits: higher energy density, faster charging, longer lifespan, and, crucially, greater safety. Traditional lithium-ion cells are prone to overheating and, in rare cases, catching fire. The solid ceramic separator in Ion's design is nonflammable, dramatically reducing that risk.\n\nThe technical heart of Ion's innovation lies in its unique ceramic electrolyte. Where most solid-state batteries struggle with expansion and contraction – often called \"breathing\" – as they charge and discharge, Ion's three-dimensional ceramic structure acts as both a separator and a buffer. The porous ceramic allows lithium ions to move efficiently between the electrodes while accommodating the physical changes that occur during cycling.\n\nThis eliminates the need for heavy compression systems, metal plates, or springs that add bulk and complexity to other solid-state designs. The result is a battery that can be packaged in thin, flexible pouches, much like today's lithium-ion cells, but with far greater performance and safety.\n\nManufacturing these batteries is no small feat. The ceramic layer must be produced in meticulously clean environments, using processes more akin to semiconductor fabrication than traditional battery assembly. Ion recently invested in advanced sintering furnaces to expand its ceramic production, positioning itself to scale up from pilot production to commercial volumes. The company's new 33,000-square-foot facility employs 75 people, with plans to double that number as production ramps up.\n\nIon's batteries have already achieved impressive technical milestones. The company's cells have achieved over 1,000 charge cycles in laboratory tests, retaining more than 80% of their capacity – a key requirement for consumer electronics and electric vehicles. Unlike many solid-state prototypes that require external pressure to maintain contact between layers, Ion's design is fully compressionless and anodeless, simplifying manufacturing and integration into existing products.\n\nThe path to commercialization is notoriously difficult in the battery industry, where many promising technologies fail to scale or meet real-world demands.\n\nThe path to commercialization is notoriously difficult in the battery industry, where many promising technologies fail to scale or meet real-world demands. Yet Ion's approach has attracted significant attention from both government and industry. The company recently secured $20 million from the Department of Energy's ARPA-E program, matched by private investment, to accelerate development and manufacturing. Collaborations with global materials companies like Saint-Gobain and technology firms such as KLA are helping Ion refine its processes and prepare for broader market entry.\n\nVenture capital investment in solid-state battery startups has declined in recent years due to repeated setbacks across the sector, and while skepticism remains, Ion's progress is notable. Its batteries are already being evaluated for military applications, where reliability and safety are paramount, and for next-generation consumer electronics, where longer battery life and faster charging are highly valued.\n\nIf Ion can continue to meet its technical and manufacturing milestones, the implications are far-reaching. Solid-state batteries could enable electric vehicles with significantly longer range, smartphones that last days on a single charge, and even the electrification of heavy equipment and aircraft.\n\nFor the US and its allies, developing this technology domestically is also a strategic priority, offering a chance to reduce reliance on foreign battery suppliers and leapfrog competitors in the global energy transition.\n\nImage credit: The Wall Street Journal"

    "url": "https://analyticsindiamag.com/global-tech/why-apple-and-meta-are-ready-to-throw-billions-on-this-iit-madras-graduates-ai-startup/",
    "text": "Something new is happening in tech. In addition to building their own AI models, companies are now racing to buy startups.\n\nApple and Meta, among others, are looking to acquire promising young AI firms in a bid to stay ahead in what many are calling an “AI gold rush”. Startups like Perplexity AI, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), and Thinking Machines Lab have suddenly become hot property, each now worth billions.\n\nApple appears to be struggling with its AI strategy, a fact highlighted at the WWDC 2025 event, where Siri received no new updates. Moreover, instead of showcasing in-house developments, the company has been relying heavily on its partnership with OpenAI to stay relevant in the AI race.\n\nApple is looking to acquire Perplexity AI, a startup founded by Aravind Srinivas, an IIT Madras graduate. Known for its AI-powered search engine and chatbot platform, Perplexity is currently valued at around $14 billion (approximately ₹1.21 lakh crore).\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, the tech giant is exploring an AI search engine for Safari as it prepares for the possible end of its long-standing deal with Google. The move would also counter Samsung’s reported plans to integrate Perplexity AI into its Galaxy S26 series as the default assistant by 2026.\n\nHowever, Perplexity’s leadership has downplayed the talks, stating they have “no knowledge of any current or future M&A discussions”. This suggests that the deal remains purely speculative at this stage.\n\nNotably, Meta also considered acquiring Perplexity AI and Thinking Machine Labs before investing in Scale AI. These acquisitions are important for big tech companies in many ways, as they want to acquire their technology and talent.\n\nTalent Acquisition\n\nAI talent is hard to find, and startups often bring together some of the best minds in the field. Acquiring one helps companies build strong teams without starting from scratch. Notably, in a recent podcast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta is offering extremely high compensation packages to OpenAI employees, including signing bonuses of up to $100 million.\n\nSimilarly, Anthropic is also engaged in a talent war with OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n\n“Whereas one year ago the narrative was around pre-training compute requirements driving consolidation, today the narrative is all about talent advantages being critical in a world of increasing compute abundance,” David Cahn, partner at Sequoia Capital, wrote in an article.\n\nCahn added that Meta’s decision to acquire a 49% stake in Scale and bring in CEO Alexandr Wang to lead their new “founder mode” AI lab is an even clearer move in this direction. According to him, breakthroughs in reinforcement learning or elsewhere will require talent.\n\n“With their obsessive focus on talent, the AI labs are increasingly looking like sports teams: They are each backed by a mega-rich tech company or individual. Star players can command pay packages in the tens of millions, hundreds of millions, or, for the most outlier talent, seemingly even billions of dollars,” his article stated.\n\nHowever, he added that, unlike sports teams where players often have long-term contracts, AI employment agreements are short-term and liquid. This means anyone can be poached at any time.\n\nBig Tech’s Struggles and Desperation\n\nBoth Apple and Meta have been facing setbacks in their AI strategies. Meta’s latest model, Llama 4, didn’t receive positive feedback from the developer community\n\nand was launched with a few complaints and controversies surrounding the benchmarks.\n\nWhile the company denied any wrongdoing, its public image was affected. The company also recently saw notable talent departures, with some joining French AI firm Mistral.\n\nMoreover, Meta reportedly made an acquisition offer for Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the AI startup co-founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, which had reportedly been valued at around $32 billion during its fundraising efforts. However, the offer was declined.\n\nNonetheless, Meta is trying to hire SSI co-founder Daniel Gross and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman to strengthen its new AI division, which is headed by Wang.\n\nMeta has reorganised its AI efforts into two core divisions. The one headed by Connor Hayes focuses on integrating AI features into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the Meta AI assistant. The other, which is called AGI Foundations, is led by Ahmad Al-Dahle and Amir Frenkel and is dedicated to core AI research, including work on the Llama models.\n\nAlthough the FAIR research lab, established by Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun and previously overseen by Joelle Pineau until she left in May, continues to operate independently, some of its teams have been moved into the new structure.\n\nZuckerberg has never shied away from bold acquisitions. One of the most notable came in April 2012, when Facebook (now Meta) purchased Instagram for roughly $1 billion in cash and stock. The app, which had launched just two years earlier, had already attracted millions of users with its minimalist interface and iconic photo filters.\n\nOn the other hand, historically, Apple’s largest acquisition was Beats in 2014 for $3 billion. The Perplexity deal, if it happens, would be the biggest in Apple’s history, reflecting the company’s urgency to catch up on AI.\n\nThe company was recently sued by shareholders in a class action, alleging it misrepresented how long it would take to upgrade Siri with advanced AI, a misstep they say dragged down iPhone sales and the stock price.\n\nValuations Without Products?\n\nNotably, Thinking Machines Lab and SSI have no products to show yet. Their high valuations stem primarily from the reputation and talent of their founders. The former reportedly closed a $2 billion seed round, valuing the six-month-old startup at $10 billion, according to the Financial Times.\n\nHowever, when Murati left OpenAI and founded Thinking Machine Labs, she brought around 20 OpenAI employees with her and later expanded the team to 60 by hiring from OpenAI and other AI labs.\n\nAt the same time, SSI intends to scale AI differently, giving as much importance to safety research as to performance.\n\nPerplexity, while not building its own state-of-the-art models, has instead created a sophisticated orchestration of multiple LLMs, allowing users to choose based on their specific needs. OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy even cited it as a prime example of multi-model architecture paired with human-in-the-loop verification\n\nThe company has been actively rolling out new products. The latest is Comet, its agentic browser. It reimagines web browsing through context-aware intelligence.\n\nComet personalises responses based on a user’s browsing history and open tabs, all of which are stored locally, and not used for model training. It is now available on Windows with features like agentic search, shopping cart discounts, and email assistance.\n\nBesides, Perplexity offers finance-focused features, including a stock screener for filtering investments, earnings call transcript generation for publicly traded companies, comprehensive company profile creation, and a live dashboard displaying real-time stock data, market summaries, and upcoming earnings announcements.\n\nLast year, reports claimed that Meta is also planning to build its own search engine. This acquisition might be the answer to that.\n\nStartups now possess the talent and momentum that large tech companies require. Building from the ground up takes too long, and time is a luxury few can afford. Acquisitions are no longer optional; they are urgent. Perhaps, in the race for AI leadership, owning the correct startup can make all the difference."

    "text": "Manisha, a 37-year-old domestic worker, boards a local train every morning from Sion to Dadar in Mumbai—her short 10-minute ride serving as a sanctuary removed from the humdrum and chaos of the day. Like many urban Indians, her wait time is also her watch time. On her smartphone screen, between jostling elbows and station stops, she watches short-form videos—sometimes a quick reel, sometimes a bite-sized soap opera on YouTube. While Reels and Shorts dominate screen time during commutes and idle moments, the human pull towards compelling stories remains strong.\n\n“These few minutes are mine, I don’t have time for full shows,\" said Manisha.\n\nThis behaviour—short bursts of downtime spent snacking content—is precisely what a new wave of Indian startups is trying to tap into. Micro-dramas, 2 to 3-minute serialized episodes packed with plot twists and emotional payoffs, are vying for eyeballs that would otherwise be doomscrolling through Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts.\n\n“We want to borrow time from Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts,\" says Kushal Singhal, founder of Flick TV, which recently raised $2.3 million in a funding round led by Stellaris Venture Partners. “Storytelling was missing in snackable time. Everyone was consuming reels and shorts, but they weren’t remembering them.\"\n\nA Flick TV series packs 50–60 micro-episodes, each 2–3-minute long—designed to fit into commute windows, tea breaks, or lunch lulls. Inspired by China’s 3-7-21 content formula—scene changes every 3 seconds, hook every 7, and emotion shifts every 21—these bite-sized sagas aim to turn passive scrolling into active engagement.\n\nAlso read | Instagram's 'Blend' lets friends share Reels; influencers see audience surge\n\nWhile 70% of India’s video consumption now happens on mobile, attention spans have plunged. “We're adapting storytelling to fit the new attention window,\" says Singhal. “The audience hasn’t disappeared—they’ve just changed formats.\"\n\nUnlike traditional user-generated content (UGC), these platforms focus on Professionally Generated Content (PGC) across genres like love, crime, heartbreak, and fantasy. The audience is largely commuters, shopkeepers, and housewives—people with “wait time,\" not “spare time.\"\n\nAnother entrant, Bullet, co-founded by Azim Lalani and backed by Zee Entertainment, is going even deeper beyond metros to tier-2 and tier-3 towns. Bullet is preparing to launch in seven regional languages across India.\n\n“This is the same audience that used to watch 30-minute soap operas—now they want that in two minutes,\" says Lalani. Each Bullet story spans 60–100 minutes, with serialised episodes running between 60 and 120 seconds.\n\nMoreover, Lalani emphasised their focus on culturally-resonant content. “We don’t want to show a lot of things which are not acceptable as Indian culture,\" he said.\n\nRead this | Shorts and reels make Netflix to Amazon Prime sweat\n\nGamified mechanics let users unlock episodes via daily check-ins, referrals, and earned tokens. “It's not just content—it’s entertainment layered with game design, affordability, and personalization,\" Lalani explains.\n\nMonetisation remains a challenge\n\nDespite the promise that short videos hold, monetization remains the single biggest challenge for micro-drama platforms.\n\n“Advertising is constrained by India’s low cost per mille (CPMs), and subscriptions rarely work for short-form content. Micro-payments may hold promise—but they remain unproven at scale,\" says Ashish Pherwani, partner, media and entertainment at EY India.\n\nAdvertising revenues alone may not be enough to sustain high-quality micro-drama production, he added.\n\nBullet and Flick TV both plan to experiment with micro-payment models—users can unlock episodes individually or opt into flexible subscription packs. Brand integrations and narrative-based product placements are also being explored as alternative revenue streams.\n\n“There’s a belief that good content is platform-agnostic,\" says Pherwani. “But short-form alone doesn’t guarantee stickiness. You need compelling stories, not just format.\"\n\nAlso read | Long-format content consumption growing on YouTube in India as connected TV penetration deepens\n\nNewer entrants are building with a tech-first and data-backed approach. “The real moat is on the supply side: content velocity and hit rate,\" says Mayank Jain, principal at Stellaris Venture Partners, adding that this category won’t be built on branded talent or stars—it’ll be built on compelling storylines and high-volume original content.\n\nBullet is already building a Customer Data Platform (CDP) from day one to track viewer behaviour, content preferences, and monetisation trends. “Once you have this data, it will lead to better personalization and pricing strategies,\" says Lalani.\n\nFormat is the wrapper, story is the core\n\nAccording to Tracxn data and Mint research, short-form video platforms in India are surging in 2025. Reel Saga, founded in 2024, has more than 50,000 downloads and raised $2.1M from Picus Capital. Flick TV crossed 50,00,000 downloads, while Reelies has downloads in excess of 500,000, more than 3,000 monthly content hours from 450,000 users, and viral hits like Contract Marriage with 3.5 million views.\n\nKuku TV, launched by Kuku FM in 2025, crossed 5 million beta downloads, offering 2-min vertical dramas powered by its 45,00,000 million paying audio user base.\n\nHowever, industry veterans caution against chasing format fads. “Micro-dramas are not new—we’re just calling them something else,\" says Pherwani. “What matters is the story. A strong IP should be adaptable to any format—film, audio, series, or short,\" he added.\n\nAnd read | Content studios turn to YouTube to launch new originals despite surge in premium streaming platforms\n\nBut even as platforms fight for seconds of screen time, the goal remains simple: deliver emotional payoff in the least amount of time possible.\n\nAs Lalani puts it, “It’s not spare time—it’s wait time. And that’s now becoming entertainment time.\""

    "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/with-money-and-manpower-india-could-achieve-quantum-satellite-communication-by-2030-says-expert/article69724357.ece",
    "text": "India could be technologically capable of “quantum communication” using satellites in the “next half a decade” Professor Bhaskar Kanseri of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi, whose team recently reported an instance of quantum key distribution one kilometre apart — the farthest such transmission in India, without any connecting cables — told The Hindu in an interview.\n\nThis, however, would require large teams of well-funded multidisciplinary experts and the involvement of start-ups which are specifically geared towards such ends, Prof. Kanseri said.\n\nSafe quantum communication requires enabling a sender and receiver to get “quantum keys”, which are made of streams of photons — the carriers of light. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) employs principles of quantum mechanics: the incompletely understood principles underlying the behaviour of atomic and sub-atomic particles, including photons.\n\nWhile there are a couple of approaches in using QKD, one of them — said to be the most secure but technically harder to implement — uses quantum entanglement. Pairs of photons are naturally ‘entangled’, in a way that a change in one instantaneously reflects in the other. Applying this to encryption means that even the mere attempt by a potential hacker into a QKD-secured transmission of information becomes apparent to those communicating, thus allowing preventive measures.\n\nWhile generating such secure keys can be done through physical networks, including fibre optic cables, the goal is to be able to do it in ‘free-space’ or without such intervening wires. This is because the cost of such transmissions using cables rapidly rises once the sender and receiver are hundreds of kilometres apart. Thus the ideal step would be to involve satellites, which can act as an intermediary between any two points even if they are thousands of kilometres apart.\n\nHowever, using fibre optic cables provides a stable channel for quantum communication which free-space channels do not. Atmospheric disturbances such as turbulence, air flow, pollution, etc., particularly in a city such as the Delhi National Capital Region, made it more “challenging” to demonstrate free-space quantum communication. “The photon beam of quantum channel diverges and wanders due to these disturbances and results in more errors. Owing to these reasons, the error rates are generally higher than the fibre ones. However, with better beam control and optimisation, there is a scope to reduce these errors,” Prof. Kanseri said.\n\nChina had demonstrated satellite-based quantum communication nearly one decade ago, as they had a head start in quantum communication activities since the early 2000s, he surmised. “I strongly believe that India, which started quite recently (in the 2020s), will achieve it in next half-a-decade or so, as under the National Quantum Mission (NQM), a strong focus is to develop satellite-based long distance quantum communication,” Prof. Kanseri, who is currently in the U.S., said in an email.\n\nAs an academic institute, IIT-Delhi’s experiments in quantum communication so far were “proof of concept (POC) nature” conducted with a small team of four to five students, explained Prof Kanseri. “Satellite based quantum communication would be one of the biggest projects and require not only adequate funds but also a large, dedicated team of multidisciplinary skilled experts for developing several types of enabling technologies. Quantum startups, mentored by researchers working in quantum technologies, if funded adequately, can contribute immensely in translation of technologies from lab to market, and in prototyping quantum technologies in a focussed and faster manner. In addition, indigenous development of needed equipment and components is also required,” Prof. Kanseri said.\n\nIn 2017 and 2020, researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China, during multiple instances, generated quantum keys involving a satellite (500 km above the ground) and ground stations 1,000 and 1,700-km apart.\n\nSince 2005, there have been ground demonstrations in Europe, Canada, and the United States of free-space (without cables) QKD greater than 100 km, suggesting that India still has much to cover regarding QKD-entanglement communication.\n\nIn January 27, 2022, scientists from the Department of Space (DOS), namely, Space Applications Centre (SAC) and Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), both in Ahmedabad, jointly demonstrated quantum entanglement based real time Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) over a 300-metre atmospheric channel. In 2021, a team of scientists led by Urbasi Sinha demonstrated perhaps the first instances of such free-space communication in Bangalore over building separated by 50 metres.\n\nQuantum key distributions over much greater distances have been achieved over optical fibre networks. Prof. Kanseri’s team demonstrated an intercity quantum-communication link between Vindhyachal and Prayagraj in 2022, using commercial grade underground dark optical fibre. In 2024, the team successfully distributed quantum keys using entanglement over a 100 km spool of telecom-grade optical fibre in another project supported by the Defence Research and Development Organisation."

    "text": "CHICAGO, IL, June 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dr. Anosh Ahmed, a Chicago-based entrepreneur, physician, and Republican leader, is moving forward with plans to transform a long-vacant warehouse on Chicago’s West Side into a new cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation center. The project is advancing at a time of growing national support for blockchain technologies and digital assets, bolstered by the Trump administration’s recent pro-crypto policy stance.\n\nDr. Anosh Ahmed\n\nThe initiative aims to bring job creation, education, and tech-driven opportunity to a part of the city that has often been overlooked in previous development efforts.\n\n“This isn’t just about crypto—it’s about building a future economy right here in our community,” said Dr. Ahmed. “We’re bringing opportunity where it's long been denied.”\n\nWarehouse Revitalization for Economic Growth\n\nThe 100,000-square-foot warehouse, located in an industrial corridor on the West Side, had remained empty for more than a decade. Now, with private investment and support from technology partners, the space is being redeveloped to house crypto mining operations, blockchain development labs, fintech training centers, startup co-working areas, and workforce development programs.\n\n“This project is about more than technology. It’s about bringing real economic opportunities to communities that deserve to be part of the country’s future growth,” said Dr. Ahmed.\n\nCreating Jobs and Training the Local Workforce\n\nAt full scale, the center is projected to support more than 250 jobs, both directly and indirectly, spanning roles in IT, blockchain coding, operations, and logistics. The project will also offer paid blockchain training programs, Web3 certification courses, internships with crypto startups, and career pathways for local residents interested in the growing digital economy.\n\n“If we want to break the cycle of generational poverty, we need to build pipelines into industries that aren’t dying—they’re growing,” Dr. Ahmed said.\n\nAligned with Federal Pro-Crypto Policy\n\nThe launch of the Chicago crypto hub aligns with recent federal-level support for blockchain innovation. The Trump administration has called for greater U.S. leadership in cryptocurrency and emerging technologies, while advocating for regulatory clarity to promote innovation.\n\n“We want Chicago to be part of that conversation, and this project will help put us on the map,” Dr. Ahmed added.\n\nAbout Dr. Anosh Ahmed\n\nDr. Anosh Ahmed is a Chicago-based physician, entrepreneur, and Republican figure known for driving community-centered economic initiatives. His past work includes revitalizing health care facilities and launching employment and housing programs in underserved areas."

    "text": "From 2h ago 11.38 BST Starmer confirms willingness to make concessions on welfare bill, saying reforms must comply with 'Labour values of fairness' Keir Starmer starts his statement by talking about welfare reform – which is not the subject of the statement, but he says the main statement covers “security”, and he says he wants to start talking about social security. He goes on: On social security, I recognise there is a consensus across the house on the urgent need for reform of our welfare system, because the British people deserve protection and dignity when they are unable to work, and support into work when they can. At the moment, they are failed every single day by the broken system created by the Conservatives, which achieves neither. I know colleagues across the house are eager to start fixing that, and so am I, and that all colleagues want to get this right, and so do I. We want to see reform implemented with Labour values of fairness. That conversation will continue in the coming days, so we can begin making change together on Tuesday. Share\n\n11m ago 13.29 BST Starmer says UK and its allies considering reimposing snapback sanctions on Iran for non-compliance with nuclear conditions During his Commons statement Keir Starmer said that Britain and its allies are discussing snapback sanctions on Iran, under the terms of the 2015 JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action). He was responding to a question from the former Tory PM Rishi Sunak, who asked: The Iranian regime has long presented a threat to the United Kingdom. As the prime minister and I have both experienced, our security services have foiled almost 20 Iranian-backed plots here at home. The prospect of a regime like this having nuclear weapons is unacceptable, and so I welcome the US and Israeli action. Does the prime minister agree with me that we and our European allies should now trigger snapback sanctions unless Tehran admits the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and allows them to fully verify that all efforts to enrich enhanced uranium have ceased? Starmer replied: On snapback – I thank him for raising this. That is a consideration that we are discussing with allies. I do think that it has to be part of the pressure that we apply. Exactly when and how snapback is applied will obviously be a question of discussion, but he’s absolutely right to say that is the very discussion we should be having at the moment, and I thank him. Share\n\n18m ago 13.22 BST At the Downing Street lobby briefing a No 10 spokesperson refused to say if Keir Starmer had full confidence in Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff, who is being blamed by some Labour MPs for the welfare bill crisis. (See 10.47am.) Asked about this, the spokesperson said: We would never comment on members of Downing Street staff. The prime minister is fully focused on the job in hand. This does not necessarily mean very much. A spokesperson will often say ‘we never comment on X’ simply as a means of closing down a line of inquiry. Starmer may or may not have concerns about McSweeney, but if he had lost confidence in him, the chief of staff would be out. And he’s not. Share\n\n32m ago 13.08 BST 11% annual rise in number of children and young people with EHCPs for special needs, figures show Richard Adams Richard Adams is the Guardian’s education editor. The number of children and young people with special needs requiring support through an education, health and care plan (EHCP) continues to increase rapidly, according to the latest figures released by the government in England.\n\n\n\nNearly 100,000 new EHCPs - statutory documents that detail support agreed by councils, schools and families - were issued last year. That took the total active EHCPs up to the age of 25 to 638,700 by the start of 2025, a year-on-year rise of 11% and three times the number active in 2017. For EHCPs citing speech and language difficulties specifically, the year-on-year increase was 18%.\n\n\n\nThe increases will stoke fears that local authority budgets will come under greater strains despite the government’s announcement last week that councils will be able to keep the estimated £5bn debts off their balance sheets for another two years as it tries to find a solution.\n\n\n\nGeorgina Smerald, policy and research manager at Sense, the charity representing disabled people with complex needs, said: Our failing specialist education system means that, every single day, disabled children are being denied their basic right to access education and get the best start in life. Jane Harris, chief executive of Speech and Language UK, said: The dramatic 18% rise in children needing EHCPs for speech and language challenges shows the system is at breaking point. Schools are doing the right thing by asking for more support because speech, language and communication skills are the bedrock of a child’s ability to thrive and succeed. But teachers aren’t being given the tools to support these children. The figures show that more than 400 young people each day approached their council for special needs support last year. Tim Oliver, chair of the County Councils Network, said: Today’s new figures once again demonstrate a system in desperate need of reform. It does not work for anyone: families are facing increasing waits for support, schools do not have the capacity and resources whilst councils are building up unmanageable deficits, having spent colossal sums on support over the last decade. Share Updated at 13.11 BST\n\n47m ago 12.54 BST Starmer says Badenoch will 'never' become PM I have beefed up the post at 11.48am with more quotes from Kemi Badenoch’s diatribe against Keir Starmer at the start of this session. The statement is still going on, and Starmer has now repeatedly criticised her for what she said, particularly the suggestion that he was using the G7 and Nato summits to duck PMQs. (Badenoch was not seriously suggesting that Starmer should have missed both summits, but in using the language she did – “evaded PMQs for two weeks” – she was disaparaging the meetings, and implying they did not matter much.) In response to a question from Bradley Thomas (Con), Starmer said that Badenoch was “sliding into irrelevance”. When Labour’s Frank McNally said it was clear Badenoch should never represent the country abroad, Starmer replied: You shouldn’t worry too much about the leader of the opposition representing our country. She never will. If she did, the chair at the Nato summit would have a little sticky note on it, 'I’m busy at PMQs’. Share\n\n1h ago 12.41 BST Tory MP Mark Pritchard criticises Badenoch for tone of her response to Starmer's G7/Nato statement The Conservative MP Mark Pritchard started his question to Keir Starmer by criticsing his party leader, Kemi Badenoch, for the tone of her response to his statement. (See 11.48am.) Pritchard said: As far as possible in this place, it would be better to keep partisan politics out of national security issues. And who knows, I may get the whip withdrawn for saying that. But so be it. There are things that go beyond party politics. So can I thank the prime minister for all his hard work in the national security interests of this country. Share\n\n1h ago 12.34 BST Starmer defends US decision to bomb Iran, saying it was 'about time' someone acted to stop Iran getting nuclear weapons The independent MP Ayoub Khan said that the victory of Zohran Mamdani in the Democratic primary to be mayor of New York showed that people will no longer support hypocritical and disingenuous politicians. He said that although all MPs agreed Iran should not have nuclear weapons, the attack on Iran by Israel and the US did not engage the Caroline principle, the test under international law allowing a pre-emptive military attack. He asked if Starmer agreed, and if he would say he supported the attack. Starmer replied: If we all agree that Iran shouldn’t have nuclear weapons, it’s about time we did something about it. And what happened on Saturday night was a big step towards alleviating that threat, and that is really important. I think we now need to complete on that, and the way to compete on that is with the talks that are needed to get Iran back to the table to make sure it’s irreversible and that it can be verified. Share Updated at 12.35 BST\n\n1h ago 12.25 BST Back in the Commons Julian Lewis (Con) asked if Starmer thought that President Trump’s “love affair with Vladimir Putin is beginning to cool”. Starmer did not directly reply, but he said it was important that Nato was united last night.

It says the government should cancel next week’s debate and bring back a new bill in the autumn. In a statement Carla Denyer, the party’s co-leader, said: Labour’s welfare reform Bill is fatally flawed. No amount of backroom deal-making over the weekend will change that. Keir Starmer should pull it, consult with disabled people over the summer and come back with something workable and supportable in the autumn Share\n\n1h ago 12.14 BST Starmer does not rule out Labour MP's call for wealth tax, but restates commitment not to raise taxes for 'working people' The Labour MP Clive Efford asked Starmer if it was reasonable to expect the government to improve public services “within the current tax envelope”. He went on: Has it the time come for us to review how we tax wealth, as opposed to work, to make sure that those people who can bear the heaviest load? In response, Starmer said the government had explained how it would fund the plan to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. He added: [Efford] will know that we made a commitment in our manifesto in relation to not raising tax on working people, and we will keep to that commitment. Technically, that is not a no to a wealth tax, although Starmer did not sound as if he were embracing the idea.

The surge in the segment was led by heavy buying in private bank stocks.\n\nHeavyweight HDFC Bank shares jumped nearly 2 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 2,027 apiece, closing as one of the top gainers and biggest contributors to the uptrend in benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHDFC Bank shares have now extended gains for the third consecutive session. This comes as its subsidiary HDB Financial Services sees decent investor interest for its Rs 12,500 IPO.\n\nNotably, HDFC Bank had set tomorrow (June 27) as the record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive its dividend payment. The rise in the share price comes ahead of the record date.\n\nAU Small Finance Bank shares rose over 1.7 percent to close at Rs 821 apiece, while Axis Bank shares gained 1.5 percent to end the session at Rs 1,231 apiece.\n\nICICI Bank shares were trading nearly 1 percent higher, while IndusInd Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda and Kotak Mahindra Bank shares were trading in the green with marginal gains.\n\nDodging the uptrend in the segment, the shares of State Bank of India (SBI), Federal Bank, and IDFC First Bank were trading in the red with marginal losses.\n\nWill Bank Nifty cross 58,000 soon?\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nAnalysts however expect the bullish rally to continue, with Bank Nifty hitting further highs. \"Overall, I expect Bank Nifty to cross 58,000 over next 2-3 weeks. If it holds above 56,250, looks for an upside target of 57,050 today. I am expecting momentum in both Nifty and Bank Nifty post this expiry,\" said Chandan Taparia, Senior Vice President, Head - Derivatives & Technical Research, Motilal Oswal.\n\nWhat led to the rally?\n\nAjay Bagga, Independent Analyst, meanwhile held India's macroeconomic indicators as key to the index's growth. \"Given the manifold actions by RBI, which has cut rates, injected ample liquidity into the money markets, has been pragmatic in undertaking macro prudential easing and has been providing regulatory relief, banks are poised to benefit in the next few quarters. India's robust macro, tailwinds from a good monsoon, income tax relief injecting some purchasing power in the pockets of the middle class and falling inflation all have created a good backdrop for credit growth,\" he said.\n\nBhavik Joshi, Business Head at INVasset PMS, cited the liquidity-driven shift in the Indian financial ecosystem as a key factor behind the surge in Bank Nifty. \"The Reserve Bank of India has been at the forefront, executing a series of bold monetary actions to stimulate the economy. These include a total of 100 bps in repo rate cuts this year (25 bps each in February and April, followed by 50 bps in June), alongside a 100 bps CRR reduction. Most notably, the RBI recently conducted a $10 billion (₹87,000 crore) 3-year USD/INR swap, injecting long-term liquidity into the system,\" he said.\n\n\"Bank Nifty's leadership in 2025 is a reflection of this macro transformation. It’s not just a stock index hitting highs—it’s the financial heartbeat of a growing economy, powered by a central bank committed to supporting India’s next phase of expansion,\" he added.\n\nSunny Agrawal of SBI Securities highlighted the surge in HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank's shares as a significant driver of the surge in the bank index. \"HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank account for approximately 50% of the Bank Nifty weight and today we have seen HDFC Bank hitting life high thereby pulling the entire index up. Moreover, ICICI Bank is also trading very close to its life highs. Overall, banks are well placed to enjoy better credit growth, on the back of recent drop in repo rate, albeit, NIMs may come under pressure during 1QFY26 and then gradually improving during FY26, with strong exit in 4QFY26,\" he said.\n\nBank Nifty has been outperforming the Nifty 50 index since the beginning of 2025, posting gains of nearly 12 percent compared to the benchmark's 8 percent gain, said Ravi Singh, SVP - Retail Research, Religare Broking. Speaking about today's rise Singh said that the uptrend was helped by RBI's recent steps like cutting interest rates and reducing CRR, which made investors more confident about the profits of banks.\n\n\"On the technical charts, Bank Nifty is likely to move towards the 57,800–58,200 zone in the near term, provided it sustains firmly above the 56,800-breakout level. For the July expiry, the highest open interest build-up is observed at the 56,000 strike, indicating strong support. Overall, sentiment remains positive, with 56,500–56,200 acting as a key support zone and 57,200 as the immediate hurdle for further upside. Traders can look to deploy a “Buy on Dips” strategy in the banking index,\" Singh said.\n\nNifty Financial Services also recorded significant rise today. The index jumped nearly 1 percent to hit a fresh record high of 27,144. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, Jio Financial Services, Shriram Finance and Bajaj Finance surged over 2 percent each to emerge as the top gainers on the index.\n\nAlso read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Increasing numbers of nationalists say the R-word has been hijacked and twisted to block their campaign for a referendum on unification.\n\n“The goal of reconciliation is very worthy but it is being manipulated and bastardised,” said Kevin Rooney, the founder of Irish Border Poll, a group that lobbies for a referendum. “It has become an undisguised unionist veto.”\n\nRooney and others fear that an elusive, ill-defined rapprochement between Northern Ireland’s two biggest blocs is morphing into a precondition that gives unionists and the Irish and British governments a pretext to dodge a referendum.\n\nFor Rooney, such a precondition would entrench the status quo in an entity designed a century ago for unionist dominance – and paradoxically undermine reconciliation. “It creates a perverse incentive for hardline loyalists to resist everything and threaten violence.”\n\nUnder this scenario, tensions associated with the traditional summer marching season, or the Irish-language rap trio Kneecap’s outspoken statements on British rule, or any number of controversies, can be harnessed as purported evidence that Northern Ireland is not ready for a vote on its constitutional future.\n\nStalled momentum for unification compounds nationalist anxiety: in Northern Ireland, Catholic birthrates are dwindling, the Brexit shock has faded, and Sinn Féin faltered in Ireland’s election last November, paving the way for a renewed Fianna Fáil/Fine Gael coalition government that is in no rush for a referendum.\n\nSimon Harris, the tánaiste, has said he does not expect a vote this decade and that it is not a priority. The taoiseach, Micheal Mártin, has emphasised not unification but the government’s Shared Island Initiative, which promotes reconciliation and cross-border cooperation and infrastructure.\n\nDublin, in other words, is not putting pressure on Keir Starmer’s government for a referendum, which under the Good Friday agreement must be called if it appears that most people in Northern Ireland would vote to leave the UK.\n\nThe combined vote share for Sinn Féin and the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) has hovered at about 40% since 1998, a stagnation that has persisted despite the number of Catholics overtaking Protestants, but dwindling support for unionist parties has tilted recent elections to pro-unification candidates.\n\nView image in fullscreen An anti-Brexit billboard at the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in May 2022. Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA\n\nFor nationalists who think the conditions for a referendum will soon be met, the focus on reconciliation has set off alarm bells. Colum Eastwood, an MP and former SDLP leader, criticised what he called a “creeping normalisation” to make it a prerequisite.\n\n“Reconciliation is a moral imperative for our whole society – the southern establishment can’t use it to justify telling citizens in the north that we can’t have a decent economy, jobs and public services,” he tweeted.\n\nElaborating via email, Eastwood said creating a new, united Ireland could advance reconciliation. “Will there be tension? Yes. Can we confront that in a way that promotes understanding and actually contributes to reconciliation? Absolutely. We shouldn’t run away from that – we should be rushing into that space,” he said.\n\nLeo Varadkar, the former taoiseach, has urged the current Irish government to push for a referendum, saying the Irish state would not have been founded in 1922, nor would there have been a Good Friday agreement, if full reconciliation had been a precondition. A “50 plus one” vote in favour of unification would suffice, he told the Féile an Phobail festival in Belfast last week. “A majority is a majority” but it would be better to have “maximum consent”, he said.\n\nMichelle O’Neill, Sinn Féin’s Northern Ireland first minister, told a republican commemoration last weekend that the party remained “laser focused” on unity and urged the Irish government to put the matter before a citizens’ assembly.\n\nA report by Ireland’s Future, a non-profit that advocates unification, notes that the Good Friday agreement does not insist on reconciliation before a referendum. “Our view is that any such objective will only follow the transition to a new constitutional arrangement on our shared island. Reunification is a reconciliation project,” it says.\n\nHowever, others – unionists as well as some nationalists – say it would be reckless to call a vote for existential change unless and until Northern Ireland’s sectarian tensions ease.\n\n“Demands for a referendum will only add to communal polarisation and be entirely counter-productive,” said Liam Kennedy, a history professor at Queen’s University Belfast.\n\nHe cited the so-called peace walls that divide Catholic and Protestant areas and the region’s “unstable equilibrium” as warnings. “We need a much higher degree of reconciliation to lay the foundations of a united Ireland that would work. It would be madness for the republic to take on the political and financial burdens of unification unless it was clear most people in Northern Ireland were either satisfied with or at least accepting of Irish unity.”\n\nDavid Adams, who helped to broker the loyalist paramilitary ceasefire in 1994, said segregated housing and education had “corralled” Catholics and Protestants and embedded tribalism. “There is no violence but we remain divided. Without some sign of reconciliation advancing I don’t think the republic would touch this place with a barge pole.”\n\nPeter Shirlow, the director of the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Irish Studies, said reconciliation had in fact progressed – he cited power-sharing at Stormont, integrated workplaces, mixed marriages – but that falling Catholic birthrates and static nationalist support had weakened the referendum push. “There ain’t going to be a border poll,” he said.\n\nTrevor Ringland, a former international rugby player and unionist politician who served on the Northern Ireland Policing Board, said some referendum advocates undermined reconciliation by legitimising IRA violence during the Troubles. “They’ve been selling the message to young people that we had to kill our neighbours to achieve constitutional change.”\n\nRingland said songs such as Get Your Brits Out by Kneecap – “Brits out” was an IRA-era slogan – elided the British identity of many people in Northern Ireland. “The kids think they’re being edgy but edgy was being in the police, which meant you could get a bullet through you.”\n\nNorthern Ireland needed more reconciliation before voting on constitutional change, Ringland said. “Let’s keep a focus on building relationships and future generations can decide where to take it.”\n\nUnity advocates, in contrast, believe constitutional change – to be achieved by winning elections in Northern Ireland and prodding the Irish government into action – is a task for the current generation.\n\nRooney said: “The Dublin establishment has been lukewarm about unity for quite a while – some basically want an easy life and don’t want to think about the north at all. It’s our job to win them over.”"

    "text": "Alice Murphy from Enniscorthy took home the European Young Upcycler Award for her business idea 'Milking It.'\n\nThe awards were the culmination of a European Union funded project called Upcyclart - A Bottom Up Approach to Youth Entrepreneurship for Circular Economy. The project focuses on transforming waste materials into value and business ideas and therefore reducing environmental footprint.\n\nAlice’s idea explores alternative uses for milk filters from the dairy industry. These are single use items and therefore add up to alot of waste generated across the estimated 17,000 dairy farms in Ireland per day.\n\nShe looked into various ways of repurposing this material and developed ideas to use it as filler for new products such as calf blankets and insulation. Repurposed tent material was also used in her calf jacket design - giving new life to another material that is wasted at scale here in Ireland, particularly after festivals.\n\nAfter presenting her idea to fellow young upcycling entrepreneurs and judges in Parnu Kunstide Kool in Estonia, the winning ideas were voted on by the other participating entrepreneurs.\n\nAlice was presented with an upcycled trophy and awarded supports to the value of €2000 to develop her business idea and skills further, along with other winners from Estonia, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe idea was developed during a series of upcycling design thinking camps which were held in Y21 Studios, Enniscorthy earlier this year as part of the Upcyclart project. The camps were led by upcycling designer and entrepreneur Lynn Haughton. Haughton mentored the participants throughout the camp and during the mobility week and awards in Estonia.\n\nSpeaking on the competition, Lynn said: “'We had four excellent participants in the EU Awards representing Ireland. I'm extremely proud of all of them! Each of them really explored the waste stream they had identified and came up with some very strong solutions as a result.\"\n\nMaking up the rest of the Irish delegation was Laura Kennedy from Kilkenny, Tatenda Gamanya from Enniscorthy and Alanis McGrath from Waterford.\n\nLynn became involved from the initial stages of the 18 month project through a collaboration with project organisers Arteteka - which is a Dublin based social enterprise promoting social change through art, creativity and inclusion. Their work involves using art-based methodologies and old materials with an aim to support young people to develop a sense of self, uncover their potential and acquire new skills and meet peers across Europe.\n\n\"'This was such a wonderful opportunity and enriching experience for all the participants involved. From learning valuable, empowering skills and exploring new possibilities and ways of thinking and doing. It was opportunity to open doors and eyes while making new friends and memories that will last a lifetime,” she added."

    "text": "IRELAND NEEDS AROUND 40,000 more people employed in the construction sector if the government wants to reach targets of 50,000 new homes a year, according to an economic forecast from the ESRI.\n\nAdditionally, if the government intends to fulfil promises made in its National Development Plan (NDP), which includes building the infrastructure needed for new housing developments, another 40,000 workers would be needed.\n\nThe ESRI’s latest Quarterly Economic Commentary reiterates previous concerns about capacity constraints in infrastructure delivery, adding that a hoped-for transfer of from non-residential construction to home building has not happened.\n\nAs cost of buying and renting homes continues to rise, so too does the demand for housing. Meanwhile, many public infrastructure projects that would serve new homes have been beset by delays.\n\nInfrastructure shortcomings are creating a bottleneck in the delivery of new residential buildings because the services required are simply not yet in place in many cases.\n\nAt the same time, Ireland has nearly full employment, so finding 80,000 workers to address the seemingly perpetual housing crisis looks like a daunting task, if not an impossible one, the ESRI suggests.\n\n“We raise this issue of labour constraint on housing provision in part as a reminder of just how challenging it will be to reach a target of 50,000 housing completions or more in the current context of full employment, ” the report states.\n\nLast year, the government missed its housing target by roughly 10,000 units, with 30,330 new homes built. On top of that, housing completion targets over the next two years will be missed by around 9,000, according to the Banking & Payments Federation Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We’re seeking to achieve that increase in housing output, while at the same time trying to deliver on an enormously ambitious National Development Plan. And again, all of these things are very laudable,” outgoing ESRI director Alan Barrett told reporters in a briefing on the economic forecast.\n\nHowever, the issue with trying to reach that 50,000 goal, and the completion of the NDP, is workforce capacity.\n\nWhile the government tends to set annual housing targets, the NDP covers infrastructure investment over a ten-year period up until 2030.\n\n“If you were to get housing up from about 30,000 up to about 50,000 about 20,000 increase, you could require about 40,000 additional construction employees.\n\n“It is simply, for us, inconceivable, or at least extremely difficult to conceive how such increases in labour can actually be attained over the short run and even the medium run,” Barrett said.\n\nBarrett explained that the situation has led the ESRI to be “cautious” about the overall capacity of the economy to deliver the required infrastructural expansion.\n\nThe ESRI’s Conor O’Toole said that “capacity issues in infrastructure and housing are likely to constrain long-term growth and need continued emphasis in terms of public expenditure”.\n\nAll this means that the government needs to carefully prioritise the NDP projects in order to keep up with demand for services that come with new housing development.\n\n“For many, many years in Ireland, the constraint on development was a budget constraint,” said Barrett.\n\n“But I think you can now say, in a full employment context, the constraint is actually a labour constraint, whereby ministers still have to make difficult decisions, even if the cash is very, very plentiful,” he said.\n\nRelated Reads Tax breaks for developers? Harris 'remains to be convinced' it's the best tool to boost supply Plans to tie rents for new build apartments to inflation rate being brought to Cabinet Dereliction in Ireland: 'Something is rotten in the Irish property industry'\n\nAsked where he sees an additional 80,000 workers coming from, Barrett said: “The answer is, I can’t.”\n\nBarrett and O’Toole did offer some possible ways to address the labour shortage though.\n\nOne of the ways to get more people working in the required roles is through immigration, although that’s “not guaranteed”, according to O’Toole.\n\nSimilarly, the economists suggested that Ireland could benefit from having some large-scale international development companies doing business here.\n\nO’Toole also said that modernising construction techniques and using new technology may also help to speed up construction and therefore free up workers earlier.\n\nBut overall, O’Toole said the ESRI remains “pessimistic” about housing construction this year and into next year.\n\n“We’re just in and around 33,000 units for this year, which is 1000 shy of our previous forecast, and we’ve held next year’s forecast at about 37,000 units.”"

The air he breathed on a routine workday was thick with particulate matter—PM2.5 and PM10, to be precise. The city, a place where smog rises with the sun and hangs low till dusk, had claimed another victim. He died of a heart stroke. Doctors pointed to the usual culprits—prolonged exposure to dirty air, the kind that creeps in quietly and stays. The kind that kills early and often. Millions more have died in much the same way, in a country of 1.46 billion where air pollution continues to be both an open secret and a silent killer."
